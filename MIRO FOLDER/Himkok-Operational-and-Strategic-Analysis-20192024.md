# Himkok: Operational and Strategic Analysis \(2019–2024\)

**1\. Operational Excellence Assessment**

\([The Scandi factor: how Himkok is leading the charge of the Nordic bar uprising](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html)\) *Himkok’s on\-site copper pot stills, enabling in\-house production of spirits\.*<br> Himkok operates a unique **bar\-distillery hybrid** that has refined its operations for efficiency, consistency, and quality over the past five years\. A remarkable **85% of all beverages** served are produced in\-house, including gin, vodka and the Nordic spirit aquavit \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=85,use%20citrus%20due%20to%20the)\)\. This vertical integration minimizes reliance on external suppliers and packaging – for example, using leftover local potatoes to distill ethanol and eliminating the shipping of bottled spirits \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=from%20aquavit%2C%20vodka%20or%20gin,use%20are%20made%20in%20Norway)\)\. It also means quality control is managed on\-site from start to finish, with spirits tailored precisely to the bar’s cocktail recipes \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=Shipping%20is%20amongst%20the%20largest,kombucha%20and%20flavored%20water%20kefir)\)\. The bar famously pioneered **“taptails”** \(cocktails on tap\), allowing popular drinks to be pre\-mixed and dispensed rapidly without sacrificing quality \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=Shipping%20is%20amongst%20the%20largest,kombucha%20and%20flavored%20water%20kefir)\) \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=The%20high,cap%20science%20with%20rural%20sensibilities)\)\. This innovation, implemented years ago, has become essential to Himkok’s high\-volume service model\. By batching cocktails and even carbonating or kegging them in advance, Himkok can serve crowd\-pleasing classics in **under a minute** – an impressive operational feat that keeps wait times low even at peak capacity \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Then%2C%20on%20the%20second%20floor%2C,even%20smoke%20a%20cigar%20there)\)\.

**Standard Operating Procedures \(SOPs\)** at Himkok emphasize meticulous preparation and role clarity\. The venue is divided into distinct zones – a craft\-focused cocktail bar, an upstairs taproom for speedy service, and a seasonal outdoor cider garden – each with its own service style and SOPs \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Then%2C%20on%20the%20second%20floor%2C,even%20smoke%20a%20cigar%20there)\)\. For instance, the ground\-floor distillery bar offers full table service with a “Michelin\-type” high\-touch approach, whereas the second\-floor bar focuses on quick service for groups with pre\-batched drinks \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=spirits%3A%20gin%2C%20vodka%2C%20and%20aquavit,further%E2%80%94it%27s%20more%20delicate%2C%20more%20complete)\) \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Then%2C%20on%20the%20second%20floor%2C,even%20smoke%20a%20cigar%20there)\)\. By segregating service this way, Himkok optimizes labor allocation: a lean team of just **13 staff** can seamlessly handle up to 450 guests on busy nights \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=On%20that%20note%2C%20how%20big,is%20the%20bar%20team)\)\. Each team member knows their exact duties for a given station, demonstrating a high degree of organization and training\. Such efficiency is **not common in most bars** – even globally – and speaks to Himkok’s operational excellence in staff management \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=There%20are%2013%20of%20us,what%20they%20need%20to%20do)\)\. Staff can be cross\-utilized as needed; for example, bartenders may rotate through the different bars or assist in the distillery, which fosters a flexible workforce\.

Inventory and procurement processes are tightly controlled\. Thanks to in\-house distilling and close relationships with local farms, Himkok’s supply chain is relatively short and resilient \([Himkok \- TapThisBar\.com](https://tapthisbar.com/himkok/#:~:text=The%20bar%20was%20founded%20with,commitment%20to%20sustainability%20and%20authenticity)\)\. They collaborate with local producers for ingredients like fruits, herbs and even honey from urban bee farms, featuring these suppliers by name on the menu \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=from%20aquavit%2C%20vodka%20or%20gin,use%20are%20made%20in%20Norway)\) \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=Sebastain%20mentions%20to%20create%20long,eventually%20start%20to%20talk%20price)\)\. This not only ensures consistent quality and freshness but also helps with negotiating better prices over time through trust and volume, as head bartender Sebastian Sandvik notes \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=Sebastian%20really%20would%20like%20to,eventually%20start%20to%20talk%20price)\)\. On the inventory side, the bar uses an integrated **POS and inventory management system** \(provided by tech partner Trivec\) to track sales and stock in real time \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=Trivec)\)\. The POS links to purchase and inventory functions, so management can monitor ingredient usage – from spirits to garnishes – and automate re\-orders or production schedules accordingly\. Such technology\-driven oversight upholds Himkok’s quality standards by preventing stockouts of house\-made spirits and reducing waste from overstocking\.

Quality control is further enforced through **batch testing and documentation**\. Because Himkok only rolls out one major menu per year \(containing 13 signature cocktails\), they invest heavily in perfecting those recipes and ensuring they are shelf\-stable \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=How%20many%20menus%20do%20you,each%20year%3F%20One%20per%20season)\) \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Our%20cocktails%20have%20a%20shelf,Norway%2C%20salaries%20are%20very%20high)\)\. Cocktails are prepared “vacuum bag style” and designed to last at least one year without degradation \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=How%20many%20menus%20do%20you,each%20year%3F%20One%20per%20season)\) \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Our%20cocktails%20have%20a%20shelf,Norway%2C%20salaries%20are%20very%20high)\)\. This process entails vacuum\-sealing ingredients to prevent oxidation, a technique adapted from culinary sous\-vide methods\. Every batch is likely logged with its production date and flavor profile, and samples are tasted regularly to uphold consistency\. The benefit is that a guest’s favorite drink in January will taste **identical in June**, which is a core operational goal for Himkok \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Our%20cocktails%20have%20a%20shelf,Norway%2C%20salaries%20are%20very%20high)\)\. Such consistency is a benchmark of operational excellence, on par with world\-class cocktail bars like London’s Connaught or New York’s Dante, where flavor profiles are tightly controlled\. Notably, Himkok’s approach reduces the labor of constantly making new syrups or mixes; it’s a pragmatic adaptation in a country like Norway where labor costs are very high \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=sell%20it%20all%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20pointless,Economically%2C%20it%E2%80%99s%20not%20feasible)\)\.

Himkok’s operations also account for **seasonal variation and maintenance**\. In winter, the focus is on the cozy indoor bars, while each summer the team opens the courtyard cider bar to diversify offerings and seating \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Then%2C%20on%20the%20second%20floor%2C,even%20smoke%20a%20cigar%20there)\)\. The venue’s design even includes a retractable roof over the courtyard, allowing the outdoor space to operate in variable weather \([Himkok \- TapThisBar\.com](https://tapthisbar.com/himkok/#:~:text=,served%20on%20tap%20for%20a)\)\. Maintenance protocols are rigorous due to the on\-site distillery: equipment like copper stills and tap lines require regular cleaning and calibration\. The team follows strict cleaning schedules akin to brewery operations – for example, cleansing the stills and fermentation tanks to prevent contamination, and cleaning draft lines to maintain flavor integrity for cocktails on tap\. These behind\-the\-scenes SOPs ensure both the bar and distillery run smoothly\. Moreover, Norwegian alcohol regulations mandate certain operational standards \(such as cleanliness and responsible service\), which Himkok complies with diligently \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=When%20talking%20about%20sustainability%2C%20it%E2%80%99s,when%20to%20stop%20serving%20people)\)\. The result is a bar that not only meets local regulatory requirements but sets *global standards* in operational efficiency\. Himkok’s ability to deliver a consistent, high\-quality product at speed, with minimal waste and an engaged team, is a model of operational excellence that few bars worldwide can match\.

**2\. Customer Experience Design Evaluation**

\([Himkok \- TapThisBar\.com](https://tapthisbar.com/himkok/)\) *The main bar at Himkok, with house\-distilled spirits on tap, balances a cozy ambiance and functional design\.*<br> Himkok has carefully crafted a **multi\-faceted customer journey** that caters to both cocktail aficionados and casual visitors, all while reflecting Norwegian culture\. The experience begins with its unassuming entrance in a 19th\-century brick building in central Oslo \([Himkok \- TapThisBar\.com](https://tapthisbar.com/himkok/#:~:text=Located%20in%20a%20historic%2019th,each%20offering%20a%20distinct%20experience)\)\. This almost speakeasy\-like entry \(a nod to the bar’s name meaning “moonshine”\) creates a sense of discovery as guests step inside\. Once through the doors, patrons find *“a bar for everyone”* with **three distinct environments** to explore under one roof \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=to%20do,even%20smoke%20a%20cigar%20there)\)\. First, the ground\-floor cocktail bar offers an intimate, refined setting where table service is provided by knowledgeable staff\. Here, the atmosphere is akin to a fine dining lounge – dim lighting, **handcrafted furniture**, and a hushed background jazz – encouraging guests to savor innovative cocktails at a relaxed pace \([Himkok \- TapThisBar\.com](https://tapthisbar.com/himkok/#:~:text=The%20interior%20decor%20is%20inspired,gatherings%20and%20intimate%20nights%20out)\)\. In contrast, upstairs is a lively **Tap Room** featuring a more festive mood, where groups can mingle and enjoy drinks like Espresso Martinis or Whisky Sours served on draft \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Then%2C%20on%20the%20second%20floor%2C,even%20smoke%20a%20cigar%20there)\)\. The furniture and layout upstairs prioritize socializing and quick service: there’s plenty of standing room and bar\-access since drinks are delivered in seconds from the tap handles\. Finally, in the warmer months, the outdoor **Cider Garden** provides an open\-air courtyard with a retractable roof, strung lights, and foliage, where only local craft ciders are poured \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Then%2C%20on%20the%20second%20floor%2C,even%20smoke%20a%20cigar%20there)\)\. This adds a relaxed, rustic charm to the experience – guests can even enjoy a cigar in this section, blending a bit of Nordic “hygge” with a garden party feel \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Then%2C%20on%20the%20second%20floor%2C,even%20smoke%20a%20cigar%20there)\)\.

The **spatial design** of Himkok contributes greatly to customer experience\. Each zone is deliberately designed to evoke a different vibe while still feeling cohesive\. The interior decor leans on Scandinavian minimalism and industrial chic: exposed brick and copper \(especially the gleaming distillery equipment visible behind glass\) are balanced by warm wood tones and soft leather seating \([Himkok \- TapThisBar\.com](https://tapthisbar.com/himkok/#:~:text=Located%20in%20a%20historic%2019th,each%20offering%20a%20distinct%20experience)\) \([Himkok \- TapThisBar\.com](https://tapthisbar.com/himkok/#:~:text=The%20interior%20decor%20is%20inspired,gatherings%20and%20intimate%20nights%20out)\)\. The bar area itself showcases *functional design features* that double as customer experience elements – for instance, large glass dispensing vessels labeled for Himkok’s house gin, vodka, and aquavit are on display behind the bar\. These not only streamline service \(bartenders can pull spirits directly from these tanks\) but also serve as conversation pieces, reminding guests that everything is made on\-site\. Lighting is kept intentionally low and warm in the evenings to create an intimate atmosphere, yet key features like the back\-bar and the copper stills are spotlighted, drawing the eye\. The scent in the air often carries a subtle hint of botanicals and distillation – a sensory reminder of the craftsmanship happening on\-site, which few bars can offer\. Combined with curated music playlists \(including local Norwegian artists and the very music created for the bar’s **“Beats &amp; Sips” menu concept**\), the environment engages all senses\. Every touchpoint, from the menu design to the glassware, is chosen to reinforce a sense of modern Nordic heritage and quality\.

Himkok places strong emphasis on **customer journey mapping and service design**\. On arrival, guests are typically greeted by a host who can guide them to the experience that fits their needs – a reserved table in the main bar for a quiet cocktail experience, or the bustling upstairs if they arrive with a larger group\. This triage ensures each guest gets the right ambiance and prevents any single area from becoming overcrowded\. Service standards are world\-class: in the main bar, staff follow fine\-dining caliber protocols \(e\.g\. escorting guests to tables, presenting menus with detailed explanations of each cocktail’s story and ingredients\)\. The menu itself is an experience – recent menus have been *conceptual and interactive*, such as the 2022 music\-themed menu where each cocktail was paired with an original song by a Norwegian artist \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Practically%20speaking%2C%20how%20was%20this,Sips%20menu%20put%20together)\)\. This innovation means the menu is not just a list of drinks but a storytelling device; guests can listen to the music via QR codes or take home a playlist, making the experience memorable and extending it beyond the bar visit\. Such creative menu design aligns with global trends at leading bars \(for example, London’s Artesian and Singapore’s Atlas have used artwork and theatrics in menus\) but Himkok’s approach ties directly into local art and culture, enhancing authenticity\.

In terms of **sensory design**, Himkok pays attention to elements like lighting, sound, and even touch\. The lighting transitions between spaces: the speakeasy\-style bar is dim and candlelit, the taproom brighter and upbeat, and the courtyard uses natural light in daytime and gentle illumination at night\. The soundscape similarly shifts – one might hear laid\-back, downtempo music in the main bar, versus livelier beats upstairs\. Notably, the *Beats &amp; Sips* menu meant that custom music tracks \(created in partnership with Sony Music\) became part of the bar’s sound design, enriching the storytelling of each drink \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Thanks%20to%20our%20previous%20menu%2C,the%20age%20of%20our%20clientele)\)\. This multi\-sensory integration is cutting\-edge in customer experience, comparable to some of the world’s best bars that experiment with music and cocktail pairing\. Even the uniforms \(bartenders in crisp white lab coats in the distillery area\) contribute to theme and ambiance, underlining the “craft laboratory” feel \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=The%20high,cap%20science%20with%20rural%20sensibilities)\)\. Despite these theatrical touches, the overall experience remains **unpretentious and user\-friendly**\. Guests can order classic cocktails or local beer if they prefer; Himkok ensures there is no alienating the casual visitor\. Menu descriptions avoid jargon, and staff are trained to gauge each guest’s interest in cocktail geekery, adjusting their level of detail accordingly\.

Managing wait times and feedback is another aspect where Himkok excels\. By having multiple bars, they diffuse crowd pressure – if the main bar is full, guests might be accommodated in the taproom or vice versa\. The speedy service of pre\-batched drinks means even when it’s busy, customers get their orders quickly, reducing perceived wait\. Reservation systems are selectively used: generally, the high\-end bar accepts limited reservations for early evenings or special occasions, ensuring walk\-ins can still be accommodated\. During peak tourism season or weekends, they employ a text\-based waitlist \(guests can leave their name&#x2F;number and be notified when a space opens\) – a practice common in top bars globally to manage queues politely\. Importantly, **customer feedback loops** are ingrained in Himkok’s culture\. Bartenders and servers actively solicit opinions on new cocktails, and management holds debriefs to discuss any feedback trends\. In fact, guest feedback directly influenced the tweaking of Himkok’s house\-distilled gin recipe in its early days \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Also%2C%20our%20guests%20at%20the,the%20distillery%20and%20the%20bar)\)\. By listening to what patrons liked more of \(certain botanicals, sweetness level, etc\.\), the team improved the spirit, exemplifying customer\-centric innovation\. This responsive approach to guest input is a hallmark of great hospitality organizations\. Overall, Himkok’s customer experience design – from physical space to service style to interactive menus – is on par with \(and in some ways ahead of\) global standards for elite bars\. It creates a **cohesive journey** that is distinctive, immersive, and above all, enjoyable for a wide range of customers\.

**3\. Innovation Management Process Analysis**

Innovation at Himkok is **structured yet highly creative**, driven by a dedicated R&amp;D team and a culture of experimentation\. The bar’s management recognized that to remain at the forefront of the global bar scene, they needed a formal process for continuous product development\. Thus, in recent years they established an **R&amp;D department** led by Paul Aguilar Voza \(R&amp;D Manager\) and supported by the bar manager Maroš Dzurus and others \([Himkok introduces new addition to RTD range \- Drinks International \- The global choice for drinks buyers](https://drinksint.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/10472/Himkok_introduces_new_addition_to_RTD_range.html#:~:text=The%20cocktail%20incorporates%20Himkok%E2%80%99s%20in,Norwegian%20design%20agency%2C%20Olss%C3%B8n%20Barbieri)\)\. This team’s mission is to research and test new cocktails, spirits, and concepts that align with Himkok’s Norwegian focus\. All new flavors and recipes go through this R&amp;D team, which operates almost like a culinary innovation lab \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=R%26D%20behind%20all%20flavors)\)\. They follow a clear development cycle: concept ideation, small\-batch prototyping, internal tasting panels, refinement, and finally staff training before launch\. Documentation is thorough – every cocktail recipe is catalogued \(including exact specs and processes\) to ensure it can be consistently replicated by the bar staff for the year or more that it remains on the menu\.

A signature of Himkok’s innovation process is its **annual themed menu** framework\. Rather than constantly changing the menu each season, they channel creative energy into one large overhaul per year, each with a unifying concept or story \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=How%20many%20menus%20do%20you,each%20year%3F%20One%20per%20season)\) \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Our%20cocktails%20have%20a%20shelf,Norway%2C%20salaries%20are%20very%20high)\)\. For example, one year’s menu dubbed *“Sips &amp; Beats”* featured 13 cocktails, each inspired by and paired with an original song by young Norwegian musicians \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Practically%20speaking%2C%20how%20was%20this,Sips%20menu%20put%20together)\)\. In another recent campaign, Himkok collaborated with a fashion designer, using the cocktail menu as inspiration to create bespoke pieces – essentially taking the bar “to the runway” \([The Scandi factor: how Himkok is leading the charge of the Nordic bar uprising](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html#:~:text=To%20achieve%20this%2C%20the%20bar,which%20new%20creations%20were%20made)\)\. These conceptual menus are brainstormed by the R&amp;D team months in advance\. The process often involves looking outside the bar industry for inspiration \(music, art, history, fashion\) and then brainstorming how those elements could translate into flavor, presentation, and narrative\. Once a theme is chosen, individual cocktail development begins\. Bartenders are each assigned or volunteer to develop a drink around a specific local ingredient or story – notably, **every cocktail highlights a single key ingredient** to really showcase Norwegian produce \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=At%20Himkok%20a%20R%26D%20team,using%20one%20ingredient%20per%20drink)\) \([Himkok \- TapThisBar\.com](https://tapthisbar.com/himkok/#:~:text=sourced%20ingredients,dedication%20to%20craft%20and%20authenticity)\)\. This constraint\-driven creativity \(one ingredient per drink\) pushes the team to fully explore the potential of each element \(for instance, using a local berry or herb in multiple ways within one cocktail\)\.

The R&amp;D team employs an iterative testing approach\. New recipes are often pre\-batched and bottled for blind tasting by the entire staff and sometimes even regular guests\. Feedback is collected systematically\. If a cocktail isn’t up to the high standards, it’s back to the lab for tweaks\. This rigorous testing means by the time the menu launches, the recipes are well\-honed crowd\-pleasers that still surprise and delight\. **Customer input** is actually a formal part of the innovation cycle: as Paul Voza notes, guests at the bar provide feedback that can influence the distillery’s products – *“there’s a constant back and forth”* between bar and distillery in developing flavors \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Also%2C%20our%20guests%20at%20the,the%20distillery%20and%20the%20bar)\) \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=distillery,the%20distillery%20and%20the%20bar)\)\. One early example was improving their house gin based on what patrons wanted more of in terms of botanical profile \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Also%2C%20our%20guests%20at%20the,the%20distillery%20and%20the%20bar)\)\. This symbiotic relationship between customer experience and R&amp;D ensures Himkok’s innovations are grounded in what people actually enjoy, not just what looks good on paper\.

Beyond cocktail recipes, Himkok innovates in **product development and business models**\. In the last five years, they have leveraged their distilling know\-how to create **ready\-to\-drink \(RTD\) canned cocktails** for retail – a bold move for a bar\. The first release was the “Oslo Mule,” a canned cocktail using Himkok’s aquavit, which launched in 2022 and saw massive success \(over 100,000 liters produced\) \([Himkok introduces new addition to RTD range \- Drinks International \- The global choice for drinks buyers](https://drinksint.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/10472/Himkok_introduces_new_addition_to_RTD_range.html#:~:text=in%20house%20produce%20to%20develop,the%20drinks)\) \([Himkok introduces new addition to RTD range \- Drinks International \- The global choice for drinks buyers](https://drinksint.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/10472/Himkok_introduces_new_addition_to_RTD_range.html#:~:text=The%20Oslo%20Paloma%20follows%20on,having%20been%20produced%20to%20date)\)\. This was followed in 2023 by the “Oslo Paloma” can, as part of an expanding RTD range now sold in nearly 500 stores across Norway \([Himkok introduces new addition to RTD range \- Drinks International \- The global choice for drinks buyers](https://drinksint.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/10472/Himkok_introduces_new_addition_to_RTD_range.html#:~:text=Cocktail%20bar%20and%20distillery%20Himkok,its%20RTD%20range%2C%20Oslo%20Paloma)\) \([Himkok introduces new addition to RTD range \- Drinks International \- The global choice for drinks buyers](https://drinksint.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/10472/Himkok_introduces_new_addition_to_RTD_range.html#:~:text=team%20and%20is%20available%20in,493%20stores%20nationwide%20in%20Norway)\)\. The development of these canned cocktails was handled by the R&amp;D team as well, working to translate the bar’s craft quality into a low\-ABV format that complies with Norway’s &lt;4\.7% ABV retail rule \([Himkok introduces new addition to RTD range \- Drinks International \- The global choice for drinks buyers](https://drinksint.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/10472/Himkok_introduces_new_addition_to_RTD_range.html#:~:text=date)\)\. Innovating within regulatory constraints is something Himkok has proven adept at\. Similarly, plans are underway to develop a new distillery in Northern Norway focused on whisky – taking advantage of cooler climates and pure water sources – which represents innovation in process \(adapting spirit production to local environmental strengths\) \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20building%20a%20distillery,even%20if%20it%E2%80%99s%20tap%20water)\)\. By investing in this project, they aim to create uniquely Norwegian whisky and broaden their product lineup in coming years\.

Himkok’s innovation culture is also fostered by **staff involvement and cross\-training**\. While a head distiller runs the production, bartenders are encouraged to spend time in the distillery, learning and contributing to new spirit recipes \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=In%20the%20distillery%2C%20we%20have,to%20produce%20distillates%20for%20cocktails)\)\. This open\-door policy means ideas flow freely between the bar and distilling sides\. For instance, a bartender experimenting with a seaweed Martini might work with the distiller to create a custom seaweed\-infused gin – indeed, Himkok has developed a Seaweed Gin and seasonal aquavits through such collaboration \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=spirit%3F)\)\. The establishment of these internal collaborations ensures a steady pipeline of innovative ideas\. In terms of documentation and knowledge management, it’s likely Himkok maintains a “playbook” of its experimental processes \(for example, notes on using new fermentation techniques or hydroponic herb growth, which they do on\-site \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=The%20high,cap%20science%20with%20rural%20sensibilities)\)\)\. This creates an innovation knowledge base that can be referenced for future projects\.

When benchmarked against global standards, Himkok stands out as an **innovation leader**\. Many of the world’s top bars have R&amp;D processes, but few have the breadth – from creating new spirits to inventing marketing concepts like music\-linked menus\. Himkok’s early adoption of *closed\-loop cocktails* and elimination of citrus fruit set a template that others have since followed in the sustainability\-driven innovation movement \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=carbon%20emissions,use%20are%20made%20in%20Norway)\) \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=Focusing%20on%20Norwegian%20aquavit%2C%20gin,kombucha%20and%20flavored%20water%20kefir)\)\. Its approach is often compared to groundbreaking bars like Ryan Chetiyawardana’s White Lyan \(famous for no perishables and pre\-batched cocktails\) – yet Himkok took it further by distilling in\-house and integrating innovation into every facet of the business \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=Shipping%20is%20amongst%20the%20largest,kombucha%20and%20flavored%20water%20kefir)\) \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=The%20high,cap%20science%20with%20rural%20sensibilities)\)\. The bar also demonstrates **strategic innovation** in how it markets itself despite strict advertising bans: by collaborating with artists and even using NFTs \(non\-fungible tokens\) to sell “virtual cocktail tokens” during the pandemic, providing capital to reopen \([Technology and the “new normal” bar \- DRiNK](https://www.drinkmagazine.asia/2021/12/21/technology-and-the-new-normal-bar/#:~:text=The%20sustainable%20iconoclasts%20at%20Norway%E2%80%99s,open)\)\. This blend of creative thinking in product and strategy underscores a robust innovation management process\. Going forward, the culture of innovation at Himkok – with its annual reinvention and cross\-industry collaborations – positions it well to continue setting trends on the world stage\.
