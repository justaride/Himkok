Himkok has become the world&#39;s most influential bar \(Top 500 Bars 2024\) [Jigger Daily](https://jiggerdaily.com/top-500-bars-2024-himkok-oslo-influential-bar/) and ranks \#10 on World&#39;s 50 Best Bars [Bar Magazine \+5](https://barmagazine.com/top-500-bars-2024-celebrates-the-best-in-global-mixology/) through cultural collaborations and word\-of\-mouth alone, achieving global recognition despite operating in Norway&#39;s complete alcohol advertising ban since 1975\. [52martinis](https://52martinis.com/himkok-oslo/) The Oslo\-based bar transcends traditional hospitality through innovative partnerships with Sony Music, [50B](https://www.theworlds50best.com/bars/the-list/himkok.html) fashion designers, and Norwegian heritage brands, [The Spirits Business](https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2024/08/himkok-reveals-cocktail-menu-with-sony-music/) establishing itself as a cultural institution that celebrates Nordic identity while producing 80% of its spirits on\-site\. [52martinis \+9](https://52martinis.com/himkok-oslo/) Their success demonstrates how creative constraints can drive innovation, with partnerships spanning music, fashion, technology, and sustainability that have redefined what a modern bar can be\.

## Norway&#39;s advertising ban drives creative excellence

Operating in what industry insiders call a **&quot;dark market,&quot;** Himkok faces Norway&#39;s strictest\-in\-the\-world alcohol regulations where even photographing a cocktail glass constitutes illegal promotion\. [50B \+3](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html) Since the 1975 advertising ban extends to all platforms including social media, [Eucam \+2](https://eucam.info/regulations-on-alcohol-marketing/norway/) with **50% of alcohol businesses violating regulations** as of 2023, [NAPR](https://www.nordicalcohol.org/post/norway-1-out-of-2-promote-alcohol-on-social-media) Himkok has pioneered alternative marketing through cultural projects\. Bar Manager Maroš Dzurus explains the severity: &quot;You cannot even take a picture of the glass because it is seen as promotion of alcohol drinking\.&quot; [50B \+3](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html)

This regulatory environment has sparked remarkable innovation\. Instead of traditional marketing, Himkok creates newsworthy collaborations that generate organic media coverage\. [52martinis](https://52martinis.com/himkok-oslo/)[Jigger Daily](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/) Their **world\-first NFT cocktail menu** in 2021, created with illustrator Esra Røise, sold out in two days at prices ranging from **0\.5\-1 ETH \($1,140\-$2,282\)**\. [PUNCH \+3](https://punchdrink.com/articles/crypto-nft-cocktails-have-arrived/) The project demonstrated how cultural partnerships can circumvent advertising restrictions while building global brand recognition\. Through these conceptual menus featuring art, photography, museums, music, and fashion, Himkok maintains promotional momentum without violating regulations\. [Jigger Daily \+2](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/)

The bar&#39;s social media strategy focuses on education about distillation processes, Norwegian culture showcases, and sustainability practices rather than product promotion\. This approach has proven more effective than traditional advertising, with Himkok&#39;s rise through **seven consecutive years** on World&#39;s 50 Best Bars [HIMKOK](https://www.himkok.no/himkok)[50B](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html) achieved &quot;almost entirely by word of mouth\.&quot; [50B \+2](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html) Their success validates that excellence in craft and innovative cultural storytelling can overcome severe marketing constraints\.

## Sony Music partnership harmonizes cocktails with custom soundtracks

Himkok&#39;s groundbreaking &quot;Beats &amp; Sips&quot; collaboration with Sony Music Norway, launched September 26, 2024, represents the **first time a major record label has committed multiple artists** to create original music for a cocktail menu\. [Trendhunter \+5](https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/himkok-and-sony-music-norway) Eight Norwegian artists, including Eurovision contestant Mari Bella and TikTok sensation Sander Systad, composed songs inspired by specific cocktails, [The Spirits Business](https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2024/08/himkok-reveals-cocktail-menu-with-sony-music/) with **95% having never visited Himkok** before the project\. [The Cocktail Lovers](https://thecocktaillovers.com/beats-meets-sips-at-himkok/)[Jigger Daily](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/)

The partnership transforms drinking into a multisensory experience through QR codes linking each of the 13 cocktails to custom Spotify playlists\. [Trendhunter \+4](https://www.trendhunter.com/trends/himkok-and-sony-music-norway) **Carrot Cake** cocktail \(Jack Daniel&#39;s Bonded, carrot cake mix, unsalted butter\) inspired Mari Bella&#39;s track, while **Seabuckthorn** \(Buffalo Trace Bourbon, Cocchi Americano, seabuckthorn cordial\) prompted Sander Systad&#39;s creation\. [The Spirits Business \+2](https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2024/08/himkok-reveals-cocktail-menu-with-sony-music/) The collaboration extends beyond novelty, addressing Himkok&#39;s strategic goals of attracting younger demographics to the 10\-year\-old establishment and building networks outside the hospitality industry\. [The Cocktail Lovers](https://thecocktaillovers.com/beats-meets-sips-at-himkok/)

The launch featured a listening party at Oslo&#39;s newly opened Goldie nightclub, where guests experienced cocktails through the artists&#39; creative interpretations\. [The Spirits Business](https://www.thespiritsbusiness.com/2024/08/himkok-reveals-cocktail-menu-with-sony-music/) Sony Music&#39;s immediate approval of the concept recognized Himkok&#39;s professional reputation and the marketing potential of cultural content in Norway&#39;s restricted advertising environment\. [The Cocktail Lovers](https://thecocktaillovers.com/beats-meets-sips-at-himkok/)[Jigger Daily](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/) The partnership demonstrates how hospitality venues can leverage entertainment industry connections to create compelling experiences that transcend traditional bar offerings\.

[Spirited Drinks](https://www.spiriteddrinks.com/oslo-himkok-fashion-meets-mixology-menu/)[Nerdrum](https://nerdrum.com/product/the-nerdrum-shirt/)

The **Sea Buckthorn** cocktail, inspired by Norwegian Solo orange drink and Kvikk Lunsj chocolate, became multiple layers of vibrant orange silk mimicking the drink&#39;s shape\. [The Cocktail Lovers](https://thecocktaillovers.com/fashion-meets-mixology-in-the-new-menu-launching-at-himkok/)[Spirited Drinks](https://www.spiriteddrinks.com/oslo-himkok-fashion-meets-mixology-menu/) The **Apple** cocktail&#39;s Fireball whiskey warmth translated into flame\-inspired silhouettes using innovative heat\-reflective materials\. [Spirited Drinks](https://www.spiriteddrinks.com/oslo-himkok-fashion-meets-mixology-menu/) Each design required deep interpretation of cocktail ingredients, with Himkok providing detailed PDFs describing flavors and concepts while allowing complete creative freedom\.

## Heritage spirits sail across equators in Linie partnership

Himkok&#39;s co\-branded spirit with Linie Aquavit combines craft distillation expertise with a **200\-year\-old sea\-aging tradition**, creating a product that literally crosses the equator twice during production\. [Jigger Daily](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/)[Drinksint](https://drinksint.com/news/fullstory.php/aid/11461/Aquavit_finds_a_new_home_in_cocktails.html) The Himkok LINIE Aquavit, which departed Oslo harbor in 2023 and returned summer 2024, ages in **smoked oloroso sherry casks with birch ends** while experiencing constant rolling motion and temperature fluctuations at sea\.

This partnership merges Linie&#39;s historic process \(established 1805\) with Himkok&#39;s modern craft techniques, enhanced by birch elements connecting to Nordic botanicals\. [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Akvavit)[Linie](https://linie.com/en/explore-the-story) The collaboration launched globally through the &quot;Himkok Journey&quot; series, with the Copenhagen debut at Bird bar featuring three signature cocktails: Parsnip, Cherry, and Apple\. [Spirited Drinks](https://www.spiriteddrinks.com/oslos-himkok-takes-over-bird-in-copenhagen/) The limited\-batch production targets aquavit enthusiasts and craft spirits collectors, positioning the product as premium artisanal offering\.

The partnership exemplifies successful collaboration between heritage brands and innovative craft producers, contributing to the broader **aquavit renaissance** and growing international interest in Nordic spirits\.
