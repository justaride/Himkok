# Cash Flow &amp; Liquidity Analysis

**Operating Cash Flow:** Himkok has generated positive operating cash flow for the last three years, reflecting the profitability of operations and effective working capital management\. In **2021**, despite being a partial year of operation under the new company, strong government support and a rebound in trade likely produced solid operating cash flow \(roughly estimated NOK ~3–4m\)\. In **2022**, operating cash flow was robust – net income of NOK 1\.345m plus depreciation \(1\.591m\) plus a large working capital inflow \(they increased payables and intercompany loans\) resulted in an estimated **NOK ~7\.1m** cash from operations\. This aligns with the observation that cash was used to fund big investments in 2022\. In **2023**, operating cash flow remained healthy: net profit NOK 2\.961m plus depreciation 0\.813m gave ~3\.774m, and working capital changes added roughly \+2\.0m \(e\.g\. more accruals to group and others\) – yielding **~NOK 5\.8m** operating cash flow\. This cash was used to build cash reserves \(cash increased by NOK \+2\.558m\) and repay a bit of debt\. The **quality of earnings** is good: reported profits are largely converted to cash, excluding some timing differences\. Notably, the large financial income in 2023 \(1\.502m\) was likely non\-cash \(perhaps forgiveness of a loan or revaluation\), but even without it, cash from operations covered expenses\.

**Free Cash Flow \(FCF\):** After capital expenditures, free cash flow has been mixed\. **2022** saw negative FCF, as the company plowed cash into fixed assets and likely the whiskey venture \(capex \+ financial investments &gt; NOK 12m\)\. That was funded by operating cash and increasing debt\. **2023** likely saw positive free cash flow: with ~5\.8m from ops and relatively modest capex \(~NOK 1\.3m in new assets net of disposals\), FCF was around **NOK 4\.5m**\. This allowed debt servicing and cash build\. Over a multi\-year view, cumulative FCF is still negative due to the heavy 2022 investments, but these are expected to generate returns in coming years \(so one could consider them growth capex\)\. The **allocation of FCF** has been toward expansion rather than shareholder distribution\. In fact, instead of dividends, a group contribution was given in 2022 \(1\.996m\) – effectively upstreaming some cash to the parent, maybe for tax optimization\. No dividends have been paid otherwise, meaning earnings are largely reinvested\.

**Cash Reserves vs Fixed Costs:** At end of 2023, **cash and bank** stood at NOK 6\.161m【8†L203\-L211】\. Monthly fixed outlays \(labor, rent, utilities\) are roughly estimated at ~NOK 1\.5–2\.0m\. Thus, the cash reserves cover roughly **3 months of fixed costs**, providing a decent liquidity cushion\. This is important in a seasonal business; it means they can weather a couple of slow months or an unexpected closure \(to some extent\) without immediate crisis\. Additionally, they have unutilized overdraft&#x2F;credit lines \(not explicitly stated, but most businesses maintain one\)\. The current ratio of 1\.16【5†L77\-L85】 and quick ratio ~0\.89 indicate they are just about able to meet short\-term obligations – a slight improvement from 1\.10 in liquidity in 2022【5†L79\-L87】\. The quick ratio below 1 is due to inventory on the books; however, the high proportion of cash sales means liquidity is actually stronger than the quick ratio suggests \(inventory can be turned to cash reliably via ongoing sales\)\. The **acid test** ignoring inventory still leaves ~NOK 3\.234m \(cash \+ receivables\) vs 10\.967m current liabilities – but note, current liabilities include 2\.4m of taxes \(which will be paid out of already\-collected VAT from sales\) and 3\.9m of group payables \(which are flexible\)\. Adjusting for that, they have sufficient liquidity\.

**Seasonality of Cash Flow:** Cash flow is seasonal following earnings\. Typically, cash builds up in high season \(summer, December\) and then is drawn down in winter\. For example, after the strong summer 2023, they likely had a cash buffer that helped through the slower winter\. Government authorities in Norway also often return excess VAT or grants annually which can cause cash inflows at certain times\. **2022’s year\-end cash was low \(NOK 3\.603m\)【8†L203\-L211】** because they had just made big investments; in 2023 they wisely allowed cash to replenish to 6\.161m\. One can expect Q4 and Q1 to have cash outflows \(due to tax payments and slower sales\), and Q2–Q3 to restore cash\. The company must manage the timing of big payments \(like spirit duty, VAT quarterly\) to ensure no crunch\. So far, no liquidity crunch is evident – they did not need to take on short\-term bank debt or emergency loans even during COVID \(thanks to support and internal funding\)\.

**Working Capital Management Trends:** The trend from 2021 to 2023 shows **working capital improvements**\. Receivables were kept low, inventory grew only modestly despite revenue doubling \(indicating efficiency gains in inventory management\), and payables increased \(they used more supplier credit and intercompany financing\)\. For instance, the current ratio improved slightly and the liquidity rating went from “Tilstrekkelig” to “Tilfredsst\.” \(satisfactory\)【5†L77\-L85】\. This suggests management attention on cash management\. They likely negotiate favorable credit terms – perhaps the state monopoly pays them promptly for spirit sales, and Aass might front some RTD costs\. Additionally, by year\-end 2023 they had higher accruals \(other short\-term debt up to 2\.977m\)【10†L243\-L250】, which could include deferred salary \(13th month pay due in Jan\) or accrued expenses, effectively using the balance sheet to conserve cash\. The only caution is the reliance on the parent company for short\-term funding \(3\.881m owed\) – while it’s been a helpful tool, they will want to clear or formalize that as the business stabilizes\.

**Cash Conversion Efficiency:** A useful metric, **cash flow to net income**, shows that in 2023 operating cash ~5\.8m vs net 3\.0m, so ~190% – meaning they converted earnings into even more cash \(due to working capital release\)\. In 2022 it was even higher due to big payables increases\. This indicates conservative accounting \(no aggressive revenue recognition\) and good cash discipline\. It also gives confidence that reported profits are of high quality \(i\.e\., backed by cash\)\.

**Dividend Policy:** The company has retained earnings to strengthen equity \(no dividends yet\)\. Given the still thin equity, it’s prudent to continue retaining profits\. The group contribution in 2022 was a special case \(likely for the parent to utilize losses or for tax planning\)\. Barring that, we expect no cash dividends until major growth investments are behind and leverage is reduced\.

In summary, **Himkok’s liquidity position is sound**, especially considering the challenging recent years\. They maintain enough cash to operate smoothly and have shown they can generate cash from their operations consistently\. Key is that they avoid overextending – the upcoming capital projects must be timed so as not to drain cash below safe levels\. The positive cash flows from the bar and RTD will hopefully fund the whiskey expansion partially\. They should also keep an eye on short\-term debt: eventually that NOK 3\.9m to the parent might be called or needed elsewhere, so building an equivalent buffer would be wise\. Overall, current liquidity management earns high marks, contributing to a **“satisfactory” credit rating** for the company【5†L77\-L85】\.

## Growth Metrics &amp; Ratios

**Revenue and Profit CAGR:** Since its founding in 2015, Himkok has exhibited strong growth\. Using available data, from an estimated ~NOK 10m in 2015 to NOK 48m in 2023, the **compound annual growth rate \(CAGR\) is roughly 22–25%**\. Focusing on recent years, the recovery from the pandemic fueled a sharp rebound: 2020 to 2023 CAGR is about 47% \(as 2020 revenue was very low due to lockdowns\)\. A more normalized view: 2018–2023 CAGR ~8–10%\. The **EBITDA CAGR \(2018–2023\)** is lower, reflecting margin compression, but still positive\. Net profit grew from near zero in early years to almost NOK 3m now\. The trajectory suggests that, barring external shocks, mid\-to\-high single digit growth is sustainable from the core business, with additional spurts coming from new ventures\.

**Same\-Store Sales Growth:** Comparing bar revenue to itself \(excluding new revenue streams\), **same\-store sales** in 2022 vs 2019 were likely flat to slightly up \(the boost from global recognition offset by lingering pandemic effects early 2022\)\. In 2023, on\-premise sales likely grew a bit above inflation \(~5% YoY\) as tourism fully returned and the \#11 world rank attracted new patrons\. So, we can say **YoY same\-store sales growth** was mid\-single digits in 2023\. This is solid given an already maxed\-out venue\. It indicates the bar is finding ways to increase yield \(maybe higher prices or events\) even without more seats\. Future same\-store growth will rely on optimizing hours \(opening earlier or adding brunch? Unlikely for a bar\) or pricing&#x2F;menu innovation to increase ATV\.

**RTD Sales Growth:** The **RTD segment is experiencing explosive growth**\. Launched in 2022 with two products, by 2023 added a third \(Paloma\) and expanded to ~500 retail points【37†L187\-L195】\. The RTD sales volume likely grew by &gt;100% from launch to the end of 2023\. For instance, if 2022 saw ~50k liters sold, 2023 could be &gt;100k liters \(the interview notes they produced 100,000 liters of Paloma cocktail including bar and cans【27†L342\-L350】\)\. Revenue from RTD likely grew similarly \(perhaps from ~NOK 3–4m in partial 2022 to ~NOK 7–8m in 2023\)\. This yields a **growth rate of ~80–100%**\. As distribution saturates domestically, growth will moderate, but there’s still room: new flavors, deeper market penetration \(the Spirits Business article mentions “set to expand…with potential to export”【37†L187\-L195】\)\. If they begin exporting RTDs \(e\.g\. to neighboring Nordic countries or duty\-free\), that could drive another leap\. We project RTD revenue could reach NOK 12–15m in a couple of years, implying a ~25–30% CAGR over the next 3–5 years for that line\.

**Customer Acquisition Cost \(CAC\) vs Lifetime Value \(LTV\) for RTD:** As a product line, RTDs have a different dynamic than the bar\. **CAC** for RTD can be considered in terms of marketing spend to gain a customer \(or a retail account\)\. Himkok leveraged its brand and Aass’s network, so CAC has been low\. Essentially, by being “Himkok,” stores were eager to stock the products, and initial marketing was via PR \(e\.g\. announcements in industry media\)【37†L187\-L195】\. The biggest “CAC” might be listing fees or promotions in grocery – which are limited\. Meanwhile, **LTV** of an RTD customer could be high if they develop loyalty \(e\.g\. a consumer who repeatedly buys Oslo Mule cans\)\. Given the product quality and awards, repeat purchase rate should be good\. If we quantify: suppose they spent NOK 0\.5m on launch marketing and acquired 50k customers, CAC = NOK 10 per customer\. If each customer buys an average of 10 cans over time with profit say NOK 5 each, LTV = NOK 50, an LTV&#x2F;CAC of 5x – quite favorable\. These are rough numbers, but clearly the partnership model has kept CAC low\. Maintaining brand buzz \(cocktail competitions, social media\) will keep CAC low\. LTV can increase if they expand product range \(cross\-sell to same buyers\)\. Overall, the RTD line benefits from **Himkok’s existing brand equity – a huge advantage in CAC&#x2F;LTV** compared to a startup RTD brand\.

**Projected ROI – Whiskey Distillery:** The planned whiskey distillery is a long\-term growth project\. Return on investment will come only after aged whiskey is bottled and sold, which might be 2027 onward\. If we assume they invest NOK 10m and produce a first batch that sells for NOK 15m in 5 years, that’s a raw 50% return \(not considering interim costs\) – but realistically, there will be ongoing production cycles\. The ROI will depend on scale and market reception\. Notably, interest in Scandinavian single malts is rising, so a successful “Himkok whiskey” could command premium pricing globally\. If they manage to become an iconic Norwegian whiskey, ROI could be excellent \(comparable small distilleries like Stauning in Denmark have attracted high valuations\)\. However, initial years will yield negative returns \(costs with no sales\)\. A sensible projection: IRR in the first 5 years might be negative, turning positive by year 8–10 when steady sales begin\. Over a 15\-year horizon, a well\-executed whiskey distillery could achieve an IRR of 15% or more – but that is speculative\. They appear to be banking on climate and water advantages to make a unique product【32†L137\-L145】\. We will revisit this in Sensitivity Analysis\.

**World’s 50 Best Bars Ranking vs Revenue:** There is anecdotal but strong correlation: each time Himkok climbed in ranking, global interest increased\. For example, after being named **\#17 in 2018**, 2019 was \(by reports\) a record year for Himkok’s tourist patronage\. Then in 2020–21 with the pandemic and a drop to \#43, revenues plunged\. Climbing back to **\#11 in 2024** likely contributed to a notable uptick in high\-spending visitors in late 2023 and bookings for 2024\. The ranking serves as global marketing that money can’t buy\. Many visitors will come specifically because of the list, leading to higher occupancy and even merchandise sales \(some guests buy bottled spirits as souvenirs\)\. We can estimate that being in the top 20 might add **10–15% revenue** vs if they were not on the list at all\. This could be on the order of \+NOK 5–6m annually\. Thus, the correlation is meaningful\. Himkok’s strategy of brand building and unique collaborations \(like fashion shows linked to their cocktails【35†L113\-L121】\) aims to keep them in the spotlight, which indirectly drives revenue growth\.

**Growth Rate vs Industry:** Himkok’s revenue growth outpaces typical bars \(most bars have flat or low growth unless they expand or franchise\)\. It also is growing faster than the average craft distillery in Norway \(which might grow ~5–10% annually\)\. Their multi\-channel approach is key\. If we combine all segments, a realistic near\-term growth rate is ~10% annually \(bar grows a bit, RTD high growth, whiskey adds from zero to something\)\. Longer\-term, if the whiskey and possible new venues \(maybe a second Himkok?\) come online, growth could re\-accelerate\.

To summarize, **Himkok’s growth metrics are positive**: strong historical CAGR, outstanding product line growth \(RTD\), and intangible brand factors fueling sales\. They appear to be entering a new growth phase with the distillery expansion\. The challenge will be to maintain momentum in the core bar while executing these new projects\. If successful, Himkok could transform from a single\-bar company into a small beverage group, with growth rates and multiples more akin to a startup – which is the trajectory they seem to be following\.

## Valuation Metrics

**EBITDA Multiple \(Comparables\):** Valuing a premium bar&#x2F;distillery like Himkok can draw on both hospitality and spirits industry comparables\. Pure bar businesses often sell for around **4–6× EBITDA** \(due to location dependence and limited scalability\)\. Distilleries or beverage brands can fetch higher, say **8–10× EBITDA** or more, especially if growth is high\. Himkok straddles these models\. Considering its strong brand, unique concept, and growth ventures, an investor might pay a premium multiple\. For instance, if we apply an 8× EBITDA to 2023 EBITDA \(~NOK 2\.8m\), we get ~NOK 22\.4m enterprise value\. A 6× would be ~NOK 16\.8m\. However, these figures likely undervalue the **brand intangible and growth option** \(RTD, whiskey\)\. World’s 50 Best Bars winners that have sold or raised capital \(like Singapore’s Jigger &amp; Pony group, etc\.\) have commanded higher multiples due to brand value and expansion potential – sometimes **&gt;10× EBITDA**\. If we assume 10×, that’s ~NOK 28m\. We should also consider the group’s debt: EV includes debt, so equity value would be EV minus net debt\. With net debt ~14\.5m \(20\.6m debt – 6\.1m cash\), an EV of ~22–28m would yield equity value of only ~7\.5–13\.5m\. That seems low given Himkok’s reputation; clearly, much of the value lies in future growth not captured in current EBITDA\.

**Enterprise Value from Sector Multiples:** We can approach via **revenue multiple** as well, which is common for beverage brands\. Large spirits firms trade around 4–6× revenue, but small craft brands maybe 1–2× revenue \(if mostly low\-margin bar sales\)\. Himkok’s mix complicates this: its bar revenue wouldn’t get a high multiple, but its branded products might\. If a strategic acquirer \(say a spirits company\) valued only the RTD and spirit brand part, they might pay 2–3× that segment’s revenue\. For example, RTD &amp; bottles perhaps ~NOK 10m revenue – at 2× that’s NOK 20m just for those rights, plus the bar itself valued separately\. Another angle: the **parent Something Local AS** likely views Himkok as a platform to develop brands\. The internal **Proff valuation** tool might give a hint if used \(not publicly, but the site suggests the value could be higher than book equity\)\.

Given the uncertainties, a fair **estimated enterprise value** might be in the **NOK 25–35 million** range currently\. This incorporates current profitability with a premium for brand&#x2F;growth\. If the whiskey project and RTD export succeed, that EV could increase significantly \(perhaps doubling\)\.

**Intangible Brand Value:** Himkok’s brand is a major intangible asset \(goodwill, in effect\)\. The accounts show no goodwill on books as of 2023【8†L169\-L177】, but the real **brand value** can be estimated by methods like the relief\-from\-royalty: If Himkok licensed its name to, say, a bar or product, what royalty rate could it command? Perhaps 3–5% of revenue\. On 2023 revenue 48m, that’s 1\.5–2\.4m potential royalty\. Capitalize that at a royalty multiple \(say 8×\), the brand intangible might be worth on the order of **NOK 12–20 million**\. This is admittedly speculative, but it aligns with the notion that a buyer would pay significantly for the name and recipes\. Another data point: global awards \(e\.g\. “Best International Bar” etc\.\) often translate to higher commercial value – being a perennial top 50 bar gives the brand credibility to launch products \(which they’ve done\)\. The brand enabled them to sell a **Himkok Old Tom Gin** at Vinmonopolet at a premium price \(their gin retails similar to other craft gins\)\. That reflects brand equity\. We can thus assert that **Himkok’s brand is a multi\-million NOK asset** – likely worth more than the tangible assets of the company\. It’s also key for future valuation because if they were to franchise or open a second location, the brand would drive success without having to build reputation from scratch\.

**5\-Year Projected NPV of RTD Line:** To gauge the RTD line’s value, we project cash flows over 5 years\. Assume 2023 RTD revenue ~7m, growing at 20% CAGR to ~17\.5m by 2028\. If gross margin ~45% and some marketing overhead, perhaps net contribution margin 20%\. That would yield ~NOK 1\.4m profit in 2023, rising to ~3\.5m in 2028, with cumulative cash flows maybe ~NOK 12m \(sum over 5 years discounted\)\. Discounting at ~10% \(higher risk\), the **NPV might be ~NOK 9–10m**\. If export or new products accelerate growth, it could be higher\. Conversely, competition in RTDs could dampen it\. Nonetheless, given the trajectory and partnership, an NPV in the high single\-digit millions NOK seems plausible\. A simpler market\-based valuation: RTD businesses often trade at high multiples of earnings if growing; if by 2025 it makes say 2m profit, at 10× that alone is 20m\. So clearly the RTD line holds significant optionality value\.

**Price&#x2F;Earnings \(P&#x2F;E\) Ratio vs Public Spirits Firms:** Public spirits companies \(e\.g\. Diageo, Pernod Ricard\) tend to trade around 20–25× earnings\. Smaller consumer goods firms might be 15×\. Himkok’s current **P&#x2F;E** \(based on 2023 net 2\.96m\) is not directly observable, but if we use our earlier equity value estimate ~NOK 10m, that’s a P&#x2F;E of ~3\.4 – extremely low\. This is because current earnings are suppressed by high costs and low equity base\. If one believed Himkok should trade at even a fraction of a public peer’s multiple, the implied valuation would be much higher\. For instance, at a 15× P&#x2F;E, net 3m implies equity value 45m, minus debt ~14\.5m gives EV ~59\.5m\. That might be optimistic until the new ventures bear fruit\.

In reality, a pure P&#x2F;E view is less useful here due to the growth investments\. A buyer&#x2F;investor would likely value on a **Sum\-of\-the\-Parts**: one part a stable bar business \(with say NOK 2m steady EBITDA valued at 5–6×\), plus the high\-growth RTD and future whisky \(valued on potential\)\. Such a sum might yield a higher overall multiple than current earnings alone justify\. Also, the fact that the company’s equity is only NOK 2\.136m on books【10†L249\-L257】 means a high ROE right now \(net 2\.96m on 2\.14m equity = 138% ROE\!\)\. That is not a sustainable measure, but it underscores how undervalued the book equity is relative to actual business value\.

**Benchmarking Multiples:** If we compare to other **Nordic craft distilleries** – for example Oslo Håndverksdestilleri \(OHD\) or Egge Gård if they were valued – those with strong brands have seen valuations in the tens of millions NOK, even if profits are small\. Himkok, with its bar cash flow and brand, likely would command at least as much\. Also compare to high\-end bars: very few sell equity publicly, but one analogous case is London’s **Nightjar** group which got investors to expand – their valuation hinged on brand strength, not just EBITDA\.

In conclusion, **Himkok’s current valuation \(enterprise value\)** can be roughly bracketed in the NOK 25–35m range based on conservative multiples, but the **upside potential** \(intangible value, growth options\) is significant\. If management executes on growth plans, the valuation could scale up towards a higher multiple of earnings or revenue\. Essentially, the market \(were it to sell\) would price in not just today’s earnings but the expectation that Himkok can monetize its brand globally \(through RTDs, spirits, maybe franchised venues\)\. For an investor with that vision, paying a P&#x2F;E of 20 \(or EBITDA multiple 10\+\) might be justified, which would put enterprise value closer to NOK 60m \(as a speculative high\)\. For now, any valuation must acknowledge the risky nature of expansion and the heavy debt load, which drags down valuation until more equity value is created\.

## Industry Benchmark Comparisons

To put Himkok’s figures in context, we compare against benchmarks from **top global bars, Nordic hospitality averages, and craft distilleries**:

- **Revenue per Venue:** World’s 50 Best Bars vary widely in revenue\. Many cocktail bars have annual revenue in the $1–3 million range \(≈NOK 10–30m\)\. Himkok’s NOK ~48m \(≈$4\.5m\) revenue is **among the highest for a single bar** globally\. This is partly due to its size \(multiple bars and large capacity\)\. For example, anecdotally, American Bar \(London\) or Dante \(NYC\) might do a few million USD; Himkok’s revenue likely ranks in the top tier of bar operations worldwide\. This showcases excellent utilization and suggests Himkok’s concept is commercially successful, not just critically acclaimed\.
- **Profit Margins:** High\-end bars typically operate on thin margins\. A well\-run bar might achieve 10% net margin; many run at 0–5%\. Himkok’s ~6% net is slightly above the median\. Meanwhile, **Nordic restaurant industry net margins** are around 3–4%【5†L83\-L91】 \(Norway’s high cost base\)\. So Himkok is outperforming the average Nordic hospitality outlet in profitability\. However, compared to **large distillers** \(like Arcus&#x2F;Anora in Norway, which had ~13\.5% EBITDA margin in 2019【57†L3\-L7】\), Himkok’s 5\.8% EBITDA margin is lower\. This is expected, as big distillers benefit from scale and distribution networks, whereas Himkok runs an experience\-heavy model\.
- **Cost Structure:** Labor cost ~37% at Himkok vs typically ~30% in global bar industry \(but in line with other Scandinavian operations which face high labor costs\)\. Pour cost ~28% vs global bar ideal ~20–25% – slightly higher, possibly due to including RTD\. Rent&#x2F;occupancy ~5–6% estimated, which is quite good; some bars in cities like NYC or London have rent &gt;10% of revenue, but Oslo rents, while high, are mitigated by Himkok’s high sales volume\. **Prime cost \(food\+labor\)** at ~65% is higher than US bar benchmarks \(which aim for &lt;60%\), but again in Scandinavia 65–70% is common\.
- **Employee Productivity:** Revenue per employee ~NOK 1\.26m \(≈$120k\) at Himkok\. For comparison, a typical restaurant in Norway might be ~NOK 0\.8–1\.0m per employee\. World’s best bars, due to skilled bartenders and often fewer seats, might be in a similar range ~$100k per employee, so Himkok is on the high side, indicating efficient operations albeit with a lot of staff\. Profit per employee ~NOK 78k \(≈$7k\) vs hospitality norm of only a few thousand \(some even negative\)\. So on that metric, Himkok shines, though still far from other industries \(tech etc\., which isn’t a fair comparison\)\.
- **Inventory Turnover:** A craft distillery often has slow inventory turns because of aging \(e\.g\. whiskey distilleries might turn inventory &lt;1x a year due to years of aging\)\. Himkok’s 4\.6x overall is much faster\. Versus a pure bar, which might turn liquor inventory perhaps 8–12x a year \(monthly or faster for popular items\), Himkok’s is slower – attributable to their dual nature \(bar \+ production\)\. Given they hold inventory for production and future sales, a slightly slower turn is expected\. It’s a balanced figure when splitting the difference between bar and distillery norms\.
- **Cash Conversion Cycle:** Many bars have negative CCC \(they get cash from customers before paying suppliers\)\. Himkok’s roughly \+40 days CCC is because of inventory and some receivables\. Compared to manufacturing \(which often has \+60 days\), it’s better\. It’s a bit higher than a pure bar’s likely negative CCC\. But compared to a distillery \(which might have cash tied up in barrels for 3 years – effectively CCC in hundreds of days\), Himkok’s is low\. So in between benchmarks – reflecting its hybrid model\.
- **Debt Levels:** Most independent bars carry little debt \(they are often equity\-funded by owners, or have small loans for build\-out\)\. Himkok’s ~NOK 20\.6m debt is **unusually high for a single bar**\. However, as part of a broader corporate strategy, it resembles more a startup&#x2F;growth company leverage\. Craft distilleries often take on debt or investor capital; e\.g\., Myken Distillery in Norway raised capital to expand\. A debt\-to\-asset ratio of ~91% is high by any standard – typical Norwegian SMEs might aim for 50–70%\. The trade\-off is supported by low interest costs currently\. Industry peers might caution that this is risky \(and indeed a low solidity of 9\.4% is flagged as “weak”【5†L89\-L97】\)\. But given the parent backing and internal loans, it’s a deliberate strategy\.
- **Growth &amp; Expansion:** Many top bars use their brand to expand \(e\.g\., Singapore’s Manhattan bar launched a bottled cocktail line, Employees Only opened branches in other cities\)\. Himkok’s approach with RTDs and a new distillery is comparable innovative expansion\. The success of such expansions in industry has been mixed – some bars struggle to replicate themselves, but products allow scaling\. On a **benchmark of diversification**, Himkok is ahead of most bars \(few have an on\-site distillery and a packaged product line\)\. In the spirits industry, big companies constantly extend brands; Himkok is effectively doing this on a boutique scale, which is relatively unique\.
- **Valuation Benchmarks:** If we consider any known transactions: A famous bar brand in London might sell for a few million GBP \(just for the venue goodwill\)\. Distilleries have sold at higher multiples; e\.g\., Denmark’s Stauning Whisky attracted large investment valuing it at hundreds of millions DKK – but that’s a bigger operation\. Himkok’s size and brand could arguably fetch a valuation similar to a small spirit brand\. Notably, a premium brand like **Bareksten Gin** \(from Norway\) gained a valuation of around NOK 100m in recent years; Himkok’s brand, while different, is also very strong – albeit not yet international retail scale\. So between bar and spirit brand benchmarks, Himkok sits somewhere in the middle in terms of valuation\.

In summary, **Himkok compares favorably to industry benchmarks in many areas \(revenue, brand strength, innovation\)**, while in others like leverage it’s taking on more risk than a typical bar\. Its margins are modest compared to global corporations but quite solid for its industry niche\. The strategic moves they’re making are somewhat trailblazing – very few bars in the “World’s 50 Best” have successfully created a retail product that is sold in hundreds of stores\. This positions Himkok potentially as a model for the “bar of the future” blending hospitality and product branding\. The benchmarks highlight that Himkok is punching above its weight in revenue and influence, though it must carefully manage financial fundamentals to ensure longevity\.
