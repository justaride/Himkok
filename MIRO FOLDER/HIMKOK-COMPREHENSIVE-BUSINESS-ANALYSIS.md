# HIMKOK: COMPREHENSIVE BUSINESS ANALYSIS

## **EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

Himkok \(&quot;moonshine&quot; in Norwegian\) has established itself as one of the world&#39;s premier cocktail destinations since its 2015 founding\. The Oslo\-based business combines a craft cocktail bar, an on\-site micro\-distillery, a branded RTD \(ready\-to\-drink\) product line, and consultancy services\. With consistent recognition among The World&#39;s 50 Best Bars \(peaking at \#10 in 2023\), Himkok has successfully positioned itself as the flagship of Norway&#39;s craft cocktail scene while gaining international acclaim\.

This report analyzes Himkok&#39;s business model, market positioning, operational excellence, brand identity, and growth strategies\. Our findings show that Himkok&#39;s success stems from:

1. A distinctive concept integrating Norwegian heritage with innovation
2. Vertical integration through in\-house distillation
3. Commitment to sustainability and local sourcing
4. Strategic partnerships extending the brand beyond its physical location
5. Cultural collaborations enhancing brand storytelling
6. Agile adaptation to market and regulatory challenges

With reported annual revenue of approximately NOK 48 million \(~$4\.6 million USD\) and a net profit margin of 4\.1%, Himkok has demonstrated financial viability despite Norway&#39;s high\-cost operating environment and strict alcohol regulations\. The business is now leveraging its reputation through RTD product expansion, whiskey distillery development, and consultancy services, with significant growth potential in international markets\.

## **1\. BUSINESS MODEL AND CORE OPERATIONS**

### **1\.1 Multi\-Faceted Business Structure**

Himkok operates as a hybrid business combining four main revenue streams:

**Bar Operations**: The venue features multiple distinct spaces:

- Main Distillery Bar: High\-end cocktail experience with table service
- Taptail Bar: Upper floor serving high\-volume draft cocktails
- Cider Bar: Seasonal outdoor space serving local ciders
- Additional features include a courtyard and a functioning barbershop

**Distillery Operations**: A working micro\-distillery produces approximately 10,000 liters of spirits annually \(aquavit, gin, vodka\) using a 180L hybrid copper still\. Approximately 80% of spirits served at the bar are produced in\-house\.

**RTD Product Line**: Launched in 2022, Himkok&#39;s canned cocktails \(Oslo Mule, Oslo Paloma, Snake Bite\) have gained nationwide distribution in Norway through a partnership with Aass Brewery\.

**Consultancy Services**: Himkok offers menu development, staff training, bar design, and operational guidance to other hospitality businesses, monetizing their expertise and brand recognition\.

Himkok&#39;s business model is distinguished by its vertical integration \- controlling production from distillation to final drink service \- which enables quality control, unique products, and stronger profit margins\.

### **1\.2 Financial Performance**

While detailed financials are not fully public, available data indicates:

- Annual Revenue: Approximately NOK 48 million \(~$4\.6 million USD\)
- Net Profit: NOK 1\.988 million
- Net Profit Margin: 4\.1%
- Revenue Growth: 4% year\-over\-year \(2022\-2023\)
- Profit Growth: 79% year\-over\-year \(2022\-2023\)
- Staff: 38\-42 employees

The business operates with a highly leveraged capital structure:

- Debt: NOK 20\.617 million
- Equity: NOK 2\.136 million
- Debt\-to\-Equity Ratio: 9\.7

Revenue distribution across business segments \(estimated\):

- Bar Operations: 70\-80% of revenue
- Distillery Sales: 10\-15% of revenue
- RTD Line: Growing segment \(RTD subsidiary Himkok RTD AS reported NOK 533,000 with a 95\.7% profit margin\)
- Consultancy: 5\-10% of revenue

Himkok&#39;s financial performance significantly outpaces industry averages\. The typical bar in Norway generates approximately NOK 3\.4 million annually, while Himkok&#39;s NOK 48 million represents roughly 14 times the industry average\. However, the 4\.1% net profit margin falls below the industry average of 10\-15% for bars, likely due to Norway&#39;s high operating costs and taxation\.

### **1\.3 Operational Structure and Workflow**

Himkok&#39;s operational structure is designed for efficiency while maintaining quality:

**Production Process**:

- Small\-batch distillation occurs on\-site in a space under 5 square meters
- Spirits are produced using local ingredients where possible
- Production schedule is planned around seasonal ingredients and menu requirements

**Service Model**:

- Multi\-bar concept allows for different service styles and price points within one venue
- &quot;Taptails&quot; \(cocktails on tap\) enable high\-volume service without compromising quality
- Staff are cross\-trained across multiple positions for flexibility

**Supply Chain**:

- Local sourcing of ingredients with relationships with farmers, foragers, and producers
- On\-site greenhouse for herbs reduces dependency on suppliers
- Partnership with Aass Brewery for RTD production and distribution

**Sustainability Integration**:

- Zero\-waste philosophy built into operations
- Monthly sustainability meetings with all staff
- Circular system for reusing ingredients \(spent ingredients repurposed\)
- Efforts to minimize carbon footprint through local sourcing

### **1\.4 Legal Structure and Compliance**

Himkok operates under Nye Kråka Bryggeri &amp; Destilleri AS, founded by Erk Potur\. The business navigates Norway&#39;s strict alcohol regulatory environment:

- Bar service requires municipal beverage license \(&quot;skjenkebevilling&quot;\)
- Distillation requires production license \(&quot;tilvirkningsbevilling&quot;\) from the Health Directorate
- RTD products at 4\.7% ABV strategically positioned to allow grocery store sales \(above 4\.7% requires distribution through Vinmonopolet state monopoly\)
- No alcohol advertising allowed in Norway, limiting marketing options
- High alcohol taxation affecting pricing strategy

The RTD subsidiary \(Himkok RTD AS\) is a separate business unit with its own financial reporting\.
