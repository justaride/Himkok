# Himkok Storgata Destilleri in Oslo is a unique bar\-distillery concept that has garnered global accolades\. Founded in 2015 by industry veteran Erk Potur, Himkok \(which means “moonshine” in Norwegian\) operates as both a high\-end cocktail bar and an on\-site distillery  \. The venue produces its own spirits \(aquavit, gin, vodka\), with an annual production capacity of about 10,000 liters of spirits \. This vertically integrated model not only supports the bar’s innovative cocktail program but also provides a secondary revenue stream through spirit sales and RTD \(ready\-to\-drink\) cocktails\. In fact, Himkok launched a line of canned cocktails in partnership with Norway’s Aass Brewery, enabling wider distribution of its drinks beyond the bar’s walls \. This expansion into retail products led to the creation of a separate company, Himkok RTD AS, in 2023 – which reported initial revenues of NOK 533,000 that year \(with an equivalent operating profit, indicating minimal expenses in the startup phase\) \.

**Revenue and Financing**

Publicly disclosed financial figures highlight Himkok’s strong performance in the high\-end bar sector\. In **2019**, Himkok \(together with a sister brewpub under the same ownership\) achieved a **total revenue of about NOK 51 million**, with Himkok’s share around **NOK 27 million** \. That year the business posted a pre\-tax profit of **NOK 2\.9 million** , indicating a healthy operating margin on par with or slightly above the hospitality industry’s average\. \(For context, Norway’s **bar and restaurant industry** typically operates on thin margins “well under 5%” in profitability  due to high labor and alcohol costs\.\) Himkok’s revenue in 2019 was notable – placing it among the top\-grossing bar venues in Norway\. *\(By comparison, one of the country’s largest nightlife venues, Ricks in Bergen, had about NOK 37 million in revenue in 2022 \.\)*

Like many in the industry, Himkok faced challenges during the 2020–2021 pandemic period\. While detailed financials for those years aren’t publicly reported, the bar’s management acknowledged a downturn: **sales in late 2023 were about 15% below typical levels**, even as many peer venues saw drops of 25–30% due to inflation and shifting nightlife habits \. Himkok’s relatively smaller decline suggests a degree of resilience, likely aided by its diversified model \(on\-site bottle sales and RTD products\) and strong global reputation that continued to draw patrons when possible\.

In terms of **financing and investment**, Himkok’s launch required creative funding solutions\. Founder Erk Potur has mentioned that opening a large\-scale distillery\-bar in high\-cost Oslo was financially “radical,” and it required securing investment and even negotiating with the landlord to share renovation costs \(with the landlord trusting that Potur “could pay in the long run”\) \. The initial build\-out of the 800 m² venue was a significant project \(the rehabilitation of the historic building cost on the order of NOK 14 million\)  \. There haven’t been public reports of major external equity rounds or new investors in Himkok itself since launch – the growth appears to have been funded through internal cash flows and strategic partnerships\. One such partnership is the **Aass Brewery deal** which is more a product manufacturing&#x2F;distribution agreement than a capital injection , but it leverages Aass’s production capacity and network to scale Himkok’s ready\-made cocktail sales\.

**Growth and Market Position**

Himkok’s financial growth has mirrored its rise in global renown\. From its first appearance on *The World’s 50 Best Bars* list in 2016, the bar saw increasing patronage and sales\. By 2019, revenue had roughly doubled from its early years to the **NOK 27 million** range , reflecting Himkok’s ability to draw local and international customers\. While exact market share in Norway’s bar industry is hard to quantify \(since most bars are independent and data is fragmented\), Himkok is often cited as one of the highest\-grossing single\-location bars in the country\. Its unique concept – being Oslo’s only bar with a distillery license – gives it a niche **competitive edge**\. For example, producing spirits in\-house means the bar can save on input costs and offer unique house\-brand products\. It also sidesteps some constraints of Norway’s alcohol monopoly for off\-premise sales, by keeping alcohol sales on\-premise and through brewery\-partner channels\.

Growth has also come through **product line extension**\. The launch of bottled and canned cocktails \(sold in supermarkets and via distributors\) opened a new revenue channel beyond on\-site beverage sales\. These RTD products, such as the award\-winning “Oslo Mule” and “Oslo Paloma” cocktails, allow Himkok to capitalize on its brand recognition\. Though still a small part of overall revenue \(as seen with Himkok RTD AS’s first\-year sales around NOK 0\.5 million \), this segment has potential to scale nationally and even for export, contributing to future growth\.

Another growth indicator is **production volume**: as noted, the distillery produces ~10,000 L of spirits annually \. This volume not only supplies Himkok’s bar \(reducing the need to purchase third\-party spirits\) but also feeds the wholesale market – Himkok has reportedly been selling its spirits or cocktails to other bars\. High production utilization suggests strong sales throughput; for instance, a 10,000 L&#x2F;year capacity roughly translates to tens of thousands of cocktails served with house spirits per year, indicating significant sales volume in drinks\.

It’s also worth noting that despite economic swings, Himkok has adapted operations to sustain growth\. Post\-pandemic, the bar adjusted its hours and focused on efficiency \(closing earlier on some weekdays to cut costs during slower periods\) \. Management’s focus on sustainability and innovation – from seasonal Norwegian ingredient menus to collaborations \(e\.g\. turning cocktails into fashion exhibits as a marketing angle\) – keeps the venue in the public eye, indirectly supporting financial performance through continued customer interest\.

**Profitability and Cost Structure**

Himkok’s profitability, based on available data, has been solid but not outsized – consistent with a premium bar operating in a high\-cost environment\. The **pre\-tax profit of NOK 2\.9 million on 2019’s NOK 51 million revenue** implies a profit margin of roughly 5–6% \. This aligns with industry norms; hospitality businesses in Norway often operate on slim margins due to **heavy cost components** like labor, rent, and alcohol taxes\. In Himkok’s case, key cost factors likely include: staff wages for its highly trained bartenders \(Norwegian labor costs are among the highest globally\), substantial alcohol duties on spirits it distills \(Norwegian excise taxes on liquor are significant\), and expenses for locally sourced ingredients and sustainability initiatives\.

That said, Himkok’s integrated model provides some **cost advantages**\. By distilling in\-house, the bar can lower its cost of goods for base spirits – effectively capturing the distiller’s margin internally\. Also, selling its own branded bottles \(on\-site or via partners\) has a higher margin potential compared to just reselling other brands’ liquor\. The bar’s zero\-waste and sustainability measures may also yield cost savings \(for example, reusing ingredients or streamlining inventory\)\. According to bar manager Maroš Dzurus, certain Norwegian regulations \(like requirements for recycling and energy use\) push venues toward efficient operations by default , which can mitigate waste\-related costs\.

During tougher periods \(e\.g\. the pandemic and recent economic dip\), Himkok managed to keep a lid on costs by shortening operating hours and focusing on its most profitable offerings \. The result was that even with a drop in revenue, the business remained viable and avoided the severe losses many others faced\. No public financial statements have revealed whether Himkok turned a profit or loss in 2020–2021, but the quick rebound to an **11th place global ranking by 2024** suggests that any setbacks were managed and that the bar returned to healthy trading as restrictions lifted\.

**Industry Benchmarks and Outlook**

Comparatively, Himkok stacks up well against industry benchmarks\. Its **NOK 27 million** annual bar revenue in 2019  is exceptionally high for a single establishment in Norway – for perspective, even large multi\-room nightclubs rarely exceed that \(the aforementioned Ricks AS at NOK 37 million in 2022 was highlighted as an industry\-topping figure \)\. Himkok’s ability to generate sales at this level, while maintaining a modest profit, underscores effective management in a challenging market\. Moreover, its profitability \(~5% margin\) is in line with, if not slightly better than, the average bar&#x2F;restaurant business in Norway which often struggles to reach 5% margin at all \.

Moving forward, analysts and industry observers see Himkok as a **bellwether** for high\-concept bars in the region\. Its financial performance is likely to benefit from the bar’s sustained top\-world rankings \(driving tourist traffic and premium pricing power\) and the growth of its bottled cocktail line\. If the RTD segment grows, it could improve overall margins \(as packaged product sales can scale without proportional increases in operating costs at the bar\)\. Additionally, any relief in policy – for example, calls to cut Norway’s high alcohol taxes are being made to help the hospitality sector  – would directly boost Himkok’s bottom line by reducing tax expense on spirits\.

In summary, **Himkok’s financial profile** reflects a successful upscale bar balancing innovation with business realities\. Public reports show multi\-million kroner revenues and steady profits prior to the pandemic, expansion into new revenue streams \(in\-house spirit production and retail cocktails\), and prudent cost management\. This places Himkok in a relatively strong position compared to peers\. As one of Norway’s most financially successful bars, Himkok exemplifies how a distinctive concept and diversified operations can translate into growth and resilience in the competitive nightlife and spirits industry\.
