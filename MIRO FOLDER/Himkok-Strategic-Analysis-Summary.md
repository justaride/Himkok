- Strong barriers to entry include regulatory hurdles, high capital requirements, and Himkok&#39;s first\-mover advantage

- The Nordic premium cocktail market is expected to grow 5\-10% annually

## 2\. RTD Cocktail Business

## 4\. Strategic Opportunities

- Valuable intellectual property in recipes, processes, and brand equity
- Potential for international expansion through franchising or flagship locations
- Synergies with new whiskey distillery project in northern Norway

## 5\. Financial Risk Assessment
