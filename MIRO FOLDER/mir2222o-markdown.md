**4\. Human Capital and Talent Strategy Review**

Himkok’s team is often described as the bar’s **most important asset**, and the management has cultivated a strong human capital strategy focused on diversity, training, and retention\. Despite being in Norway, the bar employs a very international staff: as of 2024 the core bar team of 13 included Norwegians, Italians, French, a Swede, a Slovakian, and others \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=What%20is%20the%20breakdown%20between,other%20nationalities%20on%20your%20team)\)\. Recruiting globally brings in a range of skills and perspectives, helping Himkok benchmark its service against world best practices\. The bar’s reputation – consistently ranking among the world’s best \(No\.10 in 2023\) – allows it to attract top bartending talent who are eager to be part of an award\-winning operation \([The Scandi factor: how Himkok is leading the charge of the Nordic bar uprising](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html#:~:text=Bars%202016%20just%20one%20year,Nikka%20Highest%20Climber%20Award%202023)\) \([Himkok \- TapThisBar\.com](https://tapthisbar.com/himkok/#:~:text=Awards%20%26%20Recognition)\)\. Once on board, new hires undergo thorough onboarding to absorb Himkok’s unique processes \(like learning the pre\-batch systems, house rules, and the ethos of using local ingredients\)\. They also receive **training from the law**: Norwegian regulations require staff to be trained to spot intoxication and refuse service accordingly, which Himkok strictly follows to ensure responsible alcohol service \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=When%20talking%20about%20sustainability%2C%20it%E2%80%99s,when%20to%20stop%20serving%20people)\)\.

A cornerstone of Himkok’s talent strategy is ongoing **education and development**\. The bar operates almost like a living lab, and bartenders are encouraged to expand their skills beyond making drinks\. For example, they have the opportunity to work with the head distiller to learn about spirit production and develop new distillates \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=In%20the%20distillery%2C%20we%20have,to%20produce%20distillates%20for%20cocktails)\)\. This not only enriches their knowledge \(few bartenders get hands\-on distilling experience\) but also increases job satisfaction through skill variety\. The R&amp;D team’s collaborative approach means junior staff can pitch ideas for new cocktails or techniques\. If an assistant bartender has an idea for using a foraged Norwegian herb, there is a path for them to contribute to the menu via the R&amp;D process\. Such inclusion makes employees feel valued\. Additionally, management hosts **monthly meetings focused on the bar’s sustainability and circular model**, where all employees can discuss ideas and progress \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=Sustainability%20work%20pays%20off%20%E2%80%93,loyalty%20for%20the%20right%20people)\)\. These forums reinforce shared values and give staff a voice in operational improvements\. It’s noted that involving staff in the sustainability mission from the start built team spirit and loyalty – *“people stayed for the long term because they felt included and rooted in shared values”*, says Sandvik \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=monthly%20meeting%20to%20discuss%20the,loyalty%20for%20the%20right%20people)\)\. This indicates that Himkok views sustainability not just as an environmental effort but as a core part of its culture and employer brand\.

**Retention and motivation** are high priorities\. The bar industry can be notorious for turnover, but Himkok has managed to retain many team members for years – a fact they partly attribute to the inspiring nature of their work \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=Sustainability%20work%20pays%20off%20%E2%80%93,loyalty%20for%20the%20right%20people)\)\. Being part of an internationally recognized, innovative bar gives staff a sense of pride and career growth that goes beyond just a paycheck\. Compensation at Himkok is competitive \(Norway’s labor laws ensure a decent base wage for hospitality workers, unlike the heavy tipping reliance in some countries\)\. While tipping exists, the culture in Norway is more modest, so Himkok emphasizes non\-monetary rewards: recognition in industry press, opportunities to travel for guest bartender shifts abroad, and internal promotions\. For instance, alumni of Himkok have gone on to win global awards \(Monica Berg, a former bar manager, won a major international bartender award in 2019, highlighting how Himkok serves as a career springboard \([LOCKDOWN, here we go again\! So tune in as The Blend has a new \.\.\.](https://australianbartender.com.au/2021/07/02/lockdown-here-we-go-again-so-tune-in-as-the-blend-has-a-new-online-series-out-now/#:~:text=,Drinks%20International%27s%202019%20%27)\)\)\. Seeing such success, current staff are motivated that they too can hone their craft here and gain global recognition\. The bar fosters a supportive environment – described by many as “family\-like” – which helps during intense times\. During the pandemic lockdowns, management was transparent with staff about the bar’s situation and even involved them in creative solutions \(like the NFT cocktail sale initiative\) to keep everyone engaged and feeling secure \([Technology and the “new normal” bar \- DRiNK](https://www.drinkmagazine.asia/2021/12/21/technology-and-the-new-normal-bar/#:~:text=The%20sustainable%20iconoclasts%20at%20Norway%E2%80%99s,open)\)\. This transparency and inclusivity likely strengthened loyalty\.

Performance management at Himkok is aligned with its excellence goals\. Staff are evaluated not just on speed or sales, but on how well they uphold the bar’s values: quality, hospitality, innovation, and sustainability\. A bartender who finds a way to repurpose a leftover ingredient, for example, might be praised just as much as one who sells the most cocktails in a night\. By broadening the definition of performance, Himkok encourages behaviors that benefit the business long\-term \(like reducing waste or maintaining consistent cocktail quality\)\. Leadership development is also nurtured from within\. Senior bartenders mentor juniors, and many of the key roles \(head bartender, bar manager\) have been filled by those who grew with the company\. The founder, Erk Potur, and other leaders appear to empower their team to make decisions and take ownership\. This empowerment is evident in how staff handle operations with little oversight – *“everyone knows what they need to do”* even on very busy nights \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Himkok%20can%20accommodate%20450%20people,what%20they%20need%20to%20do)\)\. Trust in employees’ competence is a sign of a healthy work culture\.

Comparatively, Himkok’s human capital approach meets or exceeds global standards seen in top hospitality venues\. Leading bars in cities like New York, London or Singapore often have staff training programs and good work culture, but Himkok’s integration of its **mission \(local, sustainable focus\) with daily work life** is exemplary\. Monica Berg’s philosophy resonates here: *“Sustainability is also about creating a good environment for your team… It’s no use recycling bottles if you treat your team like they are disposable\.”* \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=Bar%20manager%20Monica%20Berg%20is,%E2%80%9D)\) \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=environment%20and%20nature%3B%20it%E2%80%99s%20also,%E2%80%9D)\)\. Himkok lives this principle by ensuring staff feel respected and part of something meaningful\. In summary, through selective hiring, continuous training, values\-based culture, and clear career pathways, Himkok has built a talented, motivated team\. This human capital strength translates directly into better customer service and innovation, creating a virtuous cycle that reinforces Himkok’s world\-class status\.

**5\. Sustainability Practice Implementation Assessment**

Himkok has been internationally lauded as a **pioneer in bar sustainability**, and for good reason – in the last five years it has implemented an impressive closed\-loop, eco\-conscious operation that touches every aspect of the business\. Environmentally, the bar approaches sustainability holistically, starting from its supply chain: It produces the vast majority of its inputs in\-house or sources them locally, drastically cutting down on transport emissions and packaging waste \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=about%20a%20circular%20system%2C%20values,use%20are%20made%20in%20Norway)\)\. By distilling ~10,000 liters of spirits on\-site annually, Himkok nearly eliminated the need to ship in bottles of liquor, which was a huge source of waste in typical bars \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=Shipping%20is%20amongst%20the%20largest,kombucha%20and%20flavored%20water%20kefir)\) \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=Focusing%20on%20Norwegian%20aquavit%2C%20gin,kombucha%20and%20flavored%20water%20kefir)\)\. Instead of importing base alcohol, Himkok ferments and distills using local resources – notably fermenting surplus potatoes from a nearby farm to create neutral spirit \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=from%20aquavit%2C%20vodka%20or%20gin,use%20are%20made%20in%20Norway)\)\. This not only finds a use for agricultural byproducts but also reduces the carbon footprint associated with traditional spirit production\. Furthermore, the bar **eschews citrus fruits** like lemons and limes, which don’t grow in Norway and must be imported over long distances \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=carbon%20emissions,use%20are%20made%20in%20Norway)\)\. In cocktail culture this is revolutionary, as citrus is a staple for sours and many classics\. Himkok’s solution is to replace citrus with locally\-sourced acids and preserved ingredients: for acidity and brightness, they employ alternatives such as fermented crabapple juice, sorrel, or other native sour flavors, as well as acid solutions created in their lab\. The result is a menu that remains vibrant and balanced but without the air miles \(and waste\) of daily citrus juice shipments \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=carbon%20emissions,use%20are%20made%20in%20Norway)\)\.

\([image](https://chatgpt.com/c/67e9c74c-0964-8010-b10e-cdd623be5637)\) *Himkok bartenders in “lab” attire craft cocktails using house\-made ingredients, embodying a science\-driven sustainable approach \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=The%20high,cap%20science%20with%20rural%20sensibilities)\) \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=Bar%20manager%20Monica%20Berg%20is,you%20treat%20your%20team%20like)\)\.*<br> The bar’s **waste reduction and resource circularity** practices are at the forefront of industry standards\. Himkok famously operates with a *“full circular system”* mindset \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=How%20did%20the%20norwegian%20bar,stay%20in%20the%20long%20term)\)\. Ingredients are reused and repurposed wherever possible: fruit off\-cuts might become syrups or cordials; spent botanicals from distilling are composted or given to local farms for feed\. They even order “ugly” produce that would otherwise be discarded due to cosmetic imperfections, thereby reducing food waste at the supplier level \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=The%20high,cap%20science%20with%20rural%20sensibilities)\) \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=hydroponic%20turbines,cap%20science%20with%20rural%20sensibilities)\)\. In summer months, a small on\-site garden and hydroponic herb towers supply fresh garnishes and seasonal ingredients, ensuring no herb goes to waste in transport \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=The%20high,cap%20science%20with%20rural%20sensibilities)\) \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=hydroponic%20turbines,cap%20science%20with%20rural%20sensibilities)\)\. Packaging waste within the bar is minimized – for instance, instead of buying commercial soft drinks or tonics \(which come in bottles or cans\), Himkok brews its own **kombucha and water kefir** as mixers \([PUNCH | The Next Generation of Sustainable Cocktail Bars](https://punchdrink.com/articles/next-generation-closed-loop-sustainable-cocktail-bars-himkok-olmsted/#:~:text=Focusing%20on%20Norwegian%20aquavit%2C%20gin,kombucha%20and%20flavored%20water%20kefir)\)\. These probiotic beverages serve as creative soda alternatives and mean fewer bottles to recycle\. When it comes to necessary supplies like glass bottles \(for their spirits or any wine&#x2F;beer they do stock\), Himkok participates in Norway’s excellent recycling program and even goes a step further: they use **recycled and reusable bottles** for their own products\. A custom\-designed bottle for Himkok’s aquavit and gin was developed to be reused many times – it’s silk\-screen printed \(no labels\) and has the bar’s address and bottle weight engraved, with only a small paper seal that is replaced each use \([Pentawards 2025 \- Dynamic Page \(cloned\_5\)](https://pentawards.com/live/ru/node/newsitem-olss-nbarbieri:-reshaping-the-future-through-beauty-and-purpose#:~:text=Himkok%20is%20the%20most%20sustainable,with%20organic%20ink%2C%20making%20the)\) \([Pentawards 2025 \- Dynamic Page \(cloned\_5\)](https://pentawards.com/live/ru/node/newsitem-olss-nbarbieri:-reshaping-the-future-through-beauty-and-purpose#:~:text=The%20bottle%20is%20inspired%20by,element%20is%20the%20paper%20seal)\)\. This durable packaging reflects an empirical, old\-apothecary aesthetic and significantly cuts down on single\-use glass \([Pentawards 2025 \- Dynamic Page \(cloned\_5\)](https://pentawards.com/live/ru/node/newsitem-olss-nbarbieri:-reshaping-the-future-through-beauty-and-purpose#:~:text=Himkok%20is%20the%20most%20sustainable,with%20organic%20ink%2C%20making%20the)\)\.

Energy and water efficiency are also part of Himkok’s sustainability practice\. The building is powered by Norway’s renewable hydroelectric grid by default \([The Scandi factor: how Himkok is leading the charge of the Nordic bar uprising](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html#:~:text=the%20Norwegian%20law%20for%20hospitality,businesses%2C%20explains%20Dzurus)\), and the team optimizes usage by, for example, batching production tasks \(distilling or ice carving\) during off\-peak hours\. Ice is a big resource in bars – at Himkok, large blocks are cut efficiently on\-site \(reducing freezer energy versus keeping many small ice machines running\)\. They likely choose equipment with good energy ratings and have maintenance routines to keep them efficient\. Norway’s regulations require separation and recycling of waste streams, and Himkok exceeds a 90% recycle rate for all its trash \([The Scandi factor: how Himkok is leading the charge of the Nordic bar uprising](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html#:~:text=the%20Norwegian%20law%20for%20hospitality,businesses%2C%20explains%20Dzurus)\)\. Anything that can’t be reused in\-house is carefully sorted – glass, plastic, organic waste – ensuring minimal landfill contribution\. Even the bar’s **menus are printed on recycled paper** or made from reused materials \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=system)\)\. It’s no surprise that when **The World’s 50 Best Bars** introduced a Sustainable Bar Award in 2018, Himkok was the inaugural winner, scoring top marks across all criteria \([The Scandi factor: how Himkok is leading the charge of the Nordic bar uprising](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html#:~:text=When%2050%20Best%20introduced%20the,for%20hospitality%20businesses%2C%20explains%20Dzurus)\)\. This set a benchmark that has since influenced bars worldwide, especially in Scandinavia, where others \(like Röda Huset in Stockholm\) have followed with local sourcing and waste reduction programs \([The Scandi factor: how Himkok is leading the charge of the Nordic bar uprising](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html#:~:text=This%20certainly%20aligns%20with%20this,shift%20in%20bars%20across%20Scandinavia)\)\.

Sustainability at Himkok isn’t only about the environment – it extends to **social and economic dimensions**\. On the social front, they uphold an inclusive, safe atmosphere\. A strict alcohol policy \(no overserving, as per law\) is enforced to ensure guest safety and community well\-being \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=When%20talking%20about%20sustainability%2C%20it%E2%80%99s,when%20to%20stop%20serving%20people)\)\. Staff are trained to kindly cut off intoxicated patrons and offer water or alternatives, fostering a culture of responsible drinking\. Economically, while some sustainable choices \(like eliminating citrus or investing in an onsite distillery\) had upfront costs, they have proven financially sustainable in the long run by saving on imports and building a unique brand that draws business \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=Sebastian%20really%20would%20like%20to,eventually%20start%20to%20talk%20price)\)\. The management clearly tracks metrics like cost savings from waste reduction and uses them to validate the efforts\. An interesting *“unexpected benefit”* Himkok found is in human sustainability: engaging staff in eco\-initiatives improved retention, which has its own economic upside \(lower hiring&#x2F;training costs\) \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=How%20did%20the%20norwegian%20bar,stay%20in%20the%20long%20term)\) \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=Sustainability%20work%20pays%20off%20%E2%80%93,loyalty%20for%20the%20right%20people)\)\. By making sustainability a core value, they attract employees who share that ethos, leading to a more committed workforce\.

When benchmarked, Himkok stands as **one of the world’s greenest bars**\. Its practices are comparable to – and often ahead of – trailblazers like London’s White Lyan \(which eliminated ice and citrus\) or New York’s existing sustainable programs\. But Himkok’s comprehensive approach, from hyper\-local sourcing to innovative packaging reuse, sets it apart\. It leverages Norway’s strong environmental regulations as a foundation and then builds atop them with creativity and initiative \([The Scandi factor: how Himkok is leading the charge of the Nordic bar uprising](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html#:~:text=the%20Norwegian%20law%20for%20hospitality,businesses%2C%20explains%20Dzurus)\) \([The Scandi factor: how Himkok is leading the charge of the Nordic bar uprising](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html#:~:text=Stockholm%2C%20just%20one%20hour%E2%80%99s%20flight,shift%20in%20bars%20across%20Scandinavia)\)\. The bar has essentially created a **circular economy microcosm**: local farmers supply ingredients; Himkok creates products and experiences with minimal waste; and any waste or empties go back into recycling or to the farms \(some Himkok bottles even return to the distillery for refill\)\. This closed\-loop philosophy is continuously refined – Sandvik suggests there is constant effort to find how to use “all the flavors of an ingredient” and new ways to be even more local and efficient \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=The%20future%20bar)\)\. As climate concerns grow, Himkok’s sustainability practice not only ensures regulatory compliance but future\-proofs the business and inspires its peers\. Their approach demonstrates that a bar can be both world\-class and planet\-friendly, embodying sustainability as a **core pillar** of operational excellence going forward \([The Scandi factor: how Himkok is leading the charge of the Nordic bar uprising](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html#:~:text=When%2050%20Best%20introduced%20the,for%20hospitality%20businesses%2C%20explains%20Dzurus)\) \([The Scandi factor: how Himkok is leading the charge of the Nordic bar uprising](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html#:~:text=Its%20dedication%20to%20sustainability%20%E2%80%93,new%20cultural%20disciplines%20intertwined%20with)\)\.

**6\. Technology Integration and Digital Transformation Analysis**

In the last five years, Himkok has progressively integrated technology to enhance operations, guest experience, and even new revenue streams\. The backbone of their tech infrastructure is a **modern POS \(Point\-of\-Sale\) and management system** that ties together sales, inventory, and staffing\. Partnering with Trivec \(a hospitality tech provider\), Himkok implemented a POS that not only processes transactions but also links to inventory management and procurement modules \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=Trivec)\)\. Each cocktail or spirit sale automatically deducts from inventory, providing real\-time stock levels of ingredients – crucial in a bar where so many components are house\-made and need timely replenishment\. Managers get data on the fastest\-moving cocktails, peak ordering times, and other analytics, allowing data\-driven decisions \(for example, knowing which cocktail kegs to prep more of before a weekend, or which ingredients to scale up in the next production run\)\. This use of **business intelligence** ensures efficiency and helps reduce waste: if a certain cocktail isn’t selling as expected, they spot it quickly and can tweak the recipe or promotion, rather than dumping unsold batches\.

Himkok’s unique service model of pre\-batched and tapped cocktails is also facilitated by technology\. They use a **beverage dispensing system** integrated with the POS – essentially, digital flow meters on the taps that can measure each pour\. This kind of system \(also provided by Trivec’s beverage tech\) tracks every drink poured from the taps, ensuring consistency in portion and updating the inventory count \([Himkok \- Trivec](https://www.trivec.no/kunder/himkok/#:~:text=Trivec)\)\. It acts as a quality assurance tool because it’s calibrated to pour the exact volume per serving, maintaining cocktail balance\. Moreover, it provides oversight to prevent shrinkage; management can compare ounces dispensed to sales recorded\. The draft cocktail setup is somewhat analogous to a beer brewery tap system but tailored to cocktails – a pioneering tech adaptation that only a handful of bars globally have employed at this scale\. During the COVID\-19 pandemic, Himkok further leaned on tech for adapting service\. Like many, they introduced **QR code menus** for contactless ordering when they reopened under distancing guidelines\. Given Norway’s quick digital adoption, guests could scan codes at tables to read the cocktail descriptions \(though actual ordering was still often via staff, due to the personalized nature of cocktails\)\.

On the customer\-facing side, Himkok has had to be creative with technology due to Norway’s strict ban on alcohol marketing \(no posting drink photos or ads on social media\) \([The Scandi factor: how Himkok is leading the charge of the Nordic bar uprising](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html#:~:text=While%20some%20laws%20have%20positively,their%20international%20profile%20and%20recognition)\) \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Exactly,fashion%E2%80%94we%20can%20still%20promote%20ourselves)\)\. They turned to indirect digital engagement: their conceptual menu collaborations \(music, art, fashion\) produced shareable digital content that isn’t overt advertising\. For example, the **Beats &amp; Sips** menu generated songs and music videos posted on YouTube and Instagram by the artists, which in turn promoted the bar experience without ever showing a cocktail \(skirting the law while still creating buzz\) \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Exactly,fashion%E2%80%94we%20can%20still%20promote%20ourselves)\) \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Basically%2C%20we%20can%E2%80%99t%20communicate%21%20But,fashion%E2%80%94we%20can%20still%20promote%20ourselves)\)\. In 2021, Himkok even experimented with blockchain technology by selling **NFTs \(non\-fungible tokens\)** tied to their cocktails \([Technology and the “new normal” bar \- DRiNK](https://www.drinkmagazine.asia/2021/12/21/technology-and-the-new-normal-bar/#:~:text=The%20sustainable%20iconoclasts%20at%20Norway%E2%80%99s,open)\)\. Patrons and collectors could buy a virtual token representing a cocktail, effectively pre\-paying and investing in the bar\. This innovative move created a new revenue stream at a critical time \(bringing in capital during lockdown\) and generated global media interest, marking Himkok as one of the first bars to use NFTs in this way \([Technology and the “new normal” bar \- DRiNK](https://www.drinkmagazine.asia/2021/12/21/technology-and-the-new-normal-bar/#:~:text=The%20sustainable%20iconoclasts%20at%20Norway%E2%80%99s,open)\)\. Such tech\-forward thinking shows a willingness to adopt emerging digital trends for business model innovation\.

Internally, technology aids **training and knowledge management** at Himkok\. With complex prep like vacuum\-infusions and precise recipes, digital logs and recipe apps are likely used to disseminate information to staff\. There is evidence that Himkok uses tools akin to a digital recipe book or database \(possibly accessible on tablets behind the bar\) so that any bartender can pull up the specifications and method for any drink at any time, ensuring consistency\. They also utilize communication platforms \(like WhatsApp or Slack groups\) for daily briefings, sharing updates on ingredient availability or new ideas quickly among the tight\-knit team\. Security tech is in place too: surveillance cameras cover the venue for safety, and age verification is strictly manual but backed by government ID\-scanning apps if needed\. Payment has been modernized – virtually all transactions are cashless, with contactless card and mobile payments being common \(Norway is a highly cashless society\)\. The POS terminals support Apple Pay, Vipps \(a Norwegian mobile pay app\), etc\., which speeds up service and appeals to the digital preferences of guests\.

From a marketing and CRM perspective, while conventional loyalty programs are not present \(bars rarely have those\), Himkok does leverage data subtly\. They keep track of special bookings and VIP guests, likely using a simple customer note system in the booking software\. This way, repeat visitors might be recognized and welcomed back personally – a touch of personalization enabled by keeping records\. Their website has also become a tech\-enabled sales channel: as of 2022, they launched an **online store** for their RTD canned cocktails and merchandise \([Ready to drink \(RTD\) \- Oslo \- HIMKOK](https://www.himkok.no/ready-to-drink-rtd#:~:text=Ready%20to%20drink%20%28RTD%29%20,Citrus%20Notes%2C%20Bold%20Ginger%20Kick)\)\. Customers can order the low\-ABV canned drinks for pickup or delivery, which was a natural extension of their product line and uses e\-commerce technology\. This digital transformation of part of their business \(retail sales\) diversified their revenue, especially useful during pandemic restrictions\.

Comparatively, **global top bars** vary in tech adoption\. In parts of Asia, app\-based ordering and robotic bartenders are emerging, whereas many classic European bars stick to old\-school methods\. Himkok strikes a balance: it keeps the front\-of\-house human and personal, but smartly uses tech in the background to enhance operations and innovate offerings\. Their use of an integrated POS&#x2F;inventory system and draft cocktail tech is on par with leading cocktail bars that emphasize efficiency \(for instance, Singapore’s Atlas Bar also uses inventory tracking, and Lion’s Share in San Diego uses draft cocktail taps\)\. Where Himkok truly stands out is in **digital\-era innovation**, like NFTs and concept\-driven social media content, which show it as more than a bar – it’s a forward\-thinking brand unafraid of the digital realm\. As technology continues to evolve \(AI\-driven mixology, augmented reality menus, etc\.\), Himkok’s track record suggests it will judiciously adopt tools that align with its ethos and enhance its world\-class hospitality\.

**7\. Operational Recommendations and Improvement Opportunities**

As Himkok looks to maintain its world\-class status and even raise the bar, several recommendations emerge from this analysis:

- **Leverage Data Analytics for Personalization:** Building on its strong tech infrastructure, Himkok can utilize customer data to personalize the guest experience even further\. For example, implementing a simple CRM that logs customer preferences \(with consent\) can allow bartenders to recall a returning guest’s favorite spirit or tailor recommendations\. Many top global venues excel at remembering guests; tech can augment this personal touch in a scalable way\.
- **Expand Production Capacity without Sacrificing Craft:** With plans underway for a new distillery \(for whisky and increased volume\) \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=No%2C%20it%20will%20remain%20there%2C,have%20a%20presence%20on%20site)\) \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Additionally%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20building%20a%20distillery,even%20if%20it%E2%80%99s%20tap%20water)\), care should be taken to preserve the craft quality and sustainable methods that define Himkok\. Investing in energy\-efficient distilling equipment and perhaps semi\-automation for labor\-intensive tasks \(like bottling and labeling, which are currently done by hand\) will improve output and consistency \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=So%20there%E2%80%99s%20a%20state%20monopoly,on%20alcohol%20sales%20in%20Norway)\)\. A **pilot plant vs\. main plant** approach is wise – keep the original distillery as an R&amp;D incubator and tourist draw, while shifting larger volume production off\-site\. This dual setup can mirror global best practices in craft spirits \(e\.g\. microbreweries that maintain a small experimental brew house after opening a bigger facility\)\.
- **Enhance Knowledge Sharing and Training Programs:** To continue developing talent, Himkok could formalize its training into a mini\-**Himkok Academy**\. This might include documented modules on advanced techniques \(like acid adjustment in cocktails, draft system maintenance, etc\.\) and even exchange programs with other top bars or local breweries&#x2F;distilleries\. Given its leadership in innovation, Himkok might also publish a case study or whitepaper on its practices \(similar to how Noma restaurant published a fermentation guide\)\. This would not only cement its thought leadership but also help standardize internal training materials\. Ensuring every new generation of staff is deeply indoctrinated in the “Himkok way” will maintain standards as the team grows\.
- **Continue Pushing Sustainability Boundaries:** Though already a leader, Himkok can set the next benchmark by aiming for **carbon neutrality**\. This could involve offsetting remaining emissions \(e\.g\. planting trees for any carbon from travel or ingredients they can’t source locally\) or participating in programs like ecoSPIRITS for any external spirits they use \([Technology and the “new normal” bar \- DRiNK](https://www.drinkmagazine.asia/2021/12/21/technology-and-the-new-normal-bar/#:~:text=Outside%20of%20bars%2C%20we%20started,the%20use%20of%20ecoSPIRITS%20technology)\)\. They could also expand their onsite solar capabilities \(if roof space permits\) to generate some power for the bar, as a showcase of urban renewable energy in hospitality\. On the waste front, pursuing a *zero\-waste* certification or publicly reporting their waste&#x2F;recycling statistics annually would demonstrate transparency and accountability, inspiring others\. Given their influence, Himkok might even spearhead a **“Sustainable Bar Collective”** in Scandinavia to share best practices and bulk\-source eco\-friendly materials \(like compostable coasters, organic straws\) for the industry\.
- **Innovate the Customer Journey \(Keep it Fresh\):** While the multi\-space concept is working brilliantly, regulars will always crave some novelty\. Himkok could consider small, **rotating pop\-ups or experiences** within the venue\. For example, a seasonal “guest takeover” where a famous bartender or a partner distillery is featured for one week, offering a special menu in the courtyard or speakeasy room\. This kind of event creates buzz and positions Himkok alongside global cocktail culture trends\. It’s also an opportunity for staff to learn from guest mixologists, contributing to talent development\. Additionally, implementing a reservation system for the main bar \(if not already\) with a user\-friendly online interface can enhance the experience for international visitors who plan trips around bar visits\. The world’s top bars often have booking systems that manage demand while still allowing some spontaneity for walk\-ins\.
- **Marketing and Community Engagement under Legal Constraints:** Since direct advertising is off the table in Norway \([The Scandi factor: how Himkok is leading the charge of the Nordic bar uprising](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html#:~:text=While%20some%20laws%20have%20positively,their%20international%20profile%20and%20recognition)\) \([Himkok \(Oslo\): a conversation with Paul Aguilar Voza](https://jiggerdaily.com/himkok-oslo-paul-aguilar-voza/#:~:text=Exactly,fashion%E2%80%94we%20can%20still%20promote%20ourselves)\), Himkok should continue its clever strategy of *cultural collaborations*\. Future menus might engage with Norwegian literature or theater, for instance, generating content that can be shared widely without breaching rules\. They could also bolster their **educational events** – hosting workshops on sustainability or cocktail techniques for the public\. This positions Himkok as a community hub and spreads its reputation by word\-of\-mouth, the very channel that has propelled it so far \([The Scandi factor: how Himkok is leading the charge of the Nordic bar uprising](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html#:~:text=Himkok%E2%80%99s%20rise%20through%20the%20ranks,%E2%80%9D)\)\. In terms of digital presence, focusing on storytelling \(through a blog or short documentary videos about their processes\) could draw global enthusiasts and reinforce the brand image, all while respecting advertising laws by “promoting knowledge, not booze\.”
- **Benchmarking and Continuous Improvement:** Lastly, as competition intensifies worldwide \([The Scandi factor: how Himkok is leading the charge of the Nordic bar uprising](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html#:~:text=Dzurus%20and%20Aguilar%20have%20no,better%20and%20better%2C%E2%80%9D%20says%20Dzurus)\), Himkok should keep benchmarking itself against both local peers and far\-flung bars\. Regular internal audits or even inviting external industry experts for feedback can reveal blind spots\. For instance, while service at Himkok is excellent, could it rival the legendary hospitality of a hotel bar like The Connaught? Perhaps more training in classic hospitality etiquette or language skills for staff could further elevate the experience for a diverse international clientele\. On the innovation side, the rise of zero\-proof cocktails \(non\-alcoholic\) is a global trend – Himkok can lead here by applying its creativity to a world\-class non\-alcoholic program, using its kombucha and botanical expertise to cater to the growing sober\-curious demographic\. Ensuring the bar remains inclusive in offerings will keep it ahead of the curve\.

In conclusion, Himkok’s operational systems, innovation, customer experience, human capital, sustainability, and tech integration form an interlocking web of strengths that make it a **benchmark institution** in the global bar industry\. By continuing to refine these areas with the recommendations above – staying true to its roots while embracing smart growth – Himkok is well positioned to sustain its excellence for the next five years and beyond\. It exemplifies how a bar can achieve *operational brilliance* and constant innovation while offering an unforgettable, world\-class experience to its guests \([The Scandi factor: how Himkok is leading the charge of the Nordic bar uprising](https://www.theworlds50best.com/stories/News/himkok-highest-climber-worlds-50-best-bars-2023.html#:~:text=Its%20dedication%20to%20sustainability%20%E2%80%93,new%20cultural%20disciplines%20intertwined%20with)\)\. Each improvement will help Himkok not only meet but set global standards, ensuring it remains a fixture in the upper echelons of the world’s best bars\.
