# Deep Analysis of Himkok’s Business Operations and Financials

**Revenue and Financial Performance**

**Annual Revenue and Profitability:** Himkok’s financial performance is noteworthy for a high\-end cocktail bar\. Operating under the umbrella company **Nye Kråka Bryggeri &amp; Destilleri AS**, which includes Himkok’s bar and distillery operations, the business reported significant revenue\. For **2023**, the company’s revenue \(*inntekt*\) was **NOK 47\.995 million** \(~$4\.6 million USD\), with a **net profit of NOK 1\.988 million**\. This translates to a net profit margin of roughly **4\.1%**\. Another subsidiary, **Himkok RTD AS** \(focused on ready\-to\-drink canned cocktails\), was established in 2023\. It showed **sales of 533,000 NOK** \(approx\. $50,000 USD\) with a **remarkably high profit margin of 95\.7%**\. The high margin is likely due to limited operational costs \(outsourced production to a partner brewery\) and initial low volume\.

**Historical Performance:** While detailed historical financial statements are proprietary, several indicators point to solid performance\. Himkok has consistently appeared on the prestigious *World’s 50 Best Bars* list since 2016, often correlating with robust business results\. In **2022**, the bar was ranked 43rd, and by **2023** it climbed to 10th place, demonstrating growth in reputation that often aligns with increased patronage and revenue\. The operating profit margins for the group’s bar operations \(*Nye Kråka Bryggeri &amp; Destilleri AS*, which includes Himkok\) were around **16\.8%**, indicating healthy profitability in a high\-cost market like Norway\. This margin suggests effective cost management despite Norway’s expensive labor and ingredient costs\.

**Diversified Income Streams:** Himkok bolsters its revenue through multiple streams beyond on\-site bar sales:

 • **On\-Site Distillery Products:** About **80% of the spirits** used in Himkok’s cocktails \(gin, vodka, aquavit\) are distilled in\-house\. While in\-house distillation isn’t cheaper \(costing ~€18\-€19 per liter to produce, similar to market prices\), it adds value by differentiating the product and attracting cocktail enthusiasts\.

 • **Ready\-to\-Drink Cocktails \(RTDs\):** Himkok launched its **RTD canned cocktail line** \(~4\.7% ABV\) to tap into off\-premise sales\. They have **three products \(Oslo Mule, Oslo Paloma, and Snake Bite\)** distributed in around **492–500 stores across Norway**\. Early production was about 100,000 liters for the Oslo Mule alone\. The RTD line quickly gained traction: by late 2023, **over 100,000 liters of Oslo Mule had been produced**\. One large client is **Norwegian Air Shuttle**, which sells Himkok’s canned cocktails onboard flights – they are top sellers on flights longer than 1\.5 hours\. This off\-premise channel provides a steady revenue stream and international brand exposure\.

 • **Consulting and Events:** Himkok leverages its brand prestige through **consultancy services**\. Branded as **Himkok Consultancy**, they offer menu development, staff training, bar design, and operational guidance to other bars  \. While financial figures for consulting are not disclosed, the initiative suggests an intent to diversify income and share their know\-how\. Additionally, hosting special events and selling **merchandise** \(like branded bottles and barware\) provide ancillary revenue\.

**Impact of External Factors:** The COVID\-19 pandemic posed challenges for Himkok, as it did for the global hospitality industry\. During Norway’s lockdowns, **Himkok temporarily closed**, focusing on minimizing product waste and maintaining team morale\. A key insight from bar manager Odd Strandbakken in April 2020 was that **top bars often survive crises through alternative income**, such as selling bottled cocktails or consulting\. In Himkok’s case, **selling their own products and the strong pre\-pandemic financial footing** helped them weather the storm\. By adapting to restrictions \(e\.g\., pivoting to RTDs and take\-home cocktail kits\), Himkok preserved its financial stability and rebounded as restrictions eased\.

**Ownership Structure and Key Stakeholders**

**Founder and Ownership:** Himkok is a privately held venture, **founded and owned by Erk Potur**, a veteran of Oslo’s bar scene\. Potur opened Himkok in 2015 as Norway’s first bar with an on\-site distillery\. He has been the driving force and retains full or majority ownership in related entities\. For example, in **Vaterland Bar &amp; Scene AS** \(another Oslo bar venture\), Potur holds a **100% ownership stake**\. Similarly, he is the **CEO and Chairman of Himkok RTD AS** and **Nye Kråka Bryggeri &amp; Destilleri AS**, indicating centralized control\.

**Corporate Structure:** The **Nye Kråka Bryggeri &amp; Destilleri AS** entity appears to consolidate multiple ventures including Himkok’s bar and possibly the legacy of *Crowbar* \(a brewpub Potur was previously involved in\)\. The company has **39 employees** as of 2023, covering bar staff, distillery operations, and administrative roles\. It is common in Norway for bar owners to operate through holding companies for different locations or purposes\. Potur’s name is attached to multiple bar companies \(e\.g\., Goldie Bar &amp; Scene AS and Sundbytunet Bar &amp; Bryggeri AS\), reflecting his role as a serial entrepreneur in the industry\.

**Key Personnel:** Beyond Potur, **Maroš Dzurus \(Bar Manager\)** and **Paul Aguilar Voza \(Head of R&amp;D\)** are key figures driving Himkok’s operations and innovation\. **Sebastian Sandvik \(Head Bartender\)** leads the bar team and sustainability initiatives\. These stakeholders are instrumental in daily operations, conceptualizing menus, and maintaining the bar’s global reputation\. While financial ownership is concentrated with Potur, Himkok’s success is also attributable to these leaders who hold de\-facto stakes in the bar’s brand equity and direction\.

**Investor and Funding Sources:** There’s no public evidence of external investors or venture capital in Himkok’s ownership\. The expansion and projects appear to be internally funded or through partnerships rather than equity financing\. Norway’s bar industry is typically funded by owners, bank loans, or reinvested profits\. Potur’s expanding group of establishments suggests that **profits from Himkok and other ventures are reinvested** to finance new projects \(such as the upcoming whiskey distillery\)\. Additionally, **strategic partnerships \(e\.g\., with Aass Brewery\)** likely come with shared investment in product development rather than direct capital injection\. To date, Potur’s **direct ownership \(100%\)** in key entities means control hasn’t been diluted through outside shareholders\.

**Business Strategy and Market Positioning**

**Concept and Differentiation:** Himkok’s core strategy is built around a unique concept: **“part\-bar, part\-distillery, part\-lab”**\. From its inception, the goal was to **redefine Norwegian cocktail culture** by focusing on local flavors \(aquavit, Nordic ingredients\) and in\-house spirit production\. In a market historically dominated by beer and wine, this positioning made Himkok stand out\. The name *Himkok* itself means “moonshine” in Norwegian, underlining a rebellious, craft spirit ethos\. This innovative model immediately garnered attention – it debuted on the World’s 50 Best Bars list just a year after opening\.

**Sustainability and Localism:** A pillar of Himkok’s strategy is **sustainability** and **local sourcing**\. The bar won the inaugural *50 Best Sustainable Bar Award* in 2018\. Practices include near\-zero waste cocktail production, seasonal Norwegian ingredients, and even a closed\-loop system for reusing resources\. Norway’s strict environmental laws \(e\.g\., mandatory recycling, renewable energy use\) align with Himkok’s ethos\. The team emphasizes using “**Norwegian produce**” and elevating local flavors, which distinguishes their cocktails and fosters community support\. By sourcing locally and listing suppliers on menus, they build goodwill and often negotiate better prices, improving margins over time\.

**Experience and Accessibility:** Despite its avant\-garde concept, Himkok aims to be **“a bar for everyone”**\. The venue is multi\-layered to cater to different audiences and occasions\. It houses **three distinct bar areas**: the upscale Distillery Bar \(table service, craft cocktails\), a high\-volume second\-floor bar for quick classics \(Espresso Martinis, Whisky Sours\), and a relaxed **cider bar \(seasonal rooftop\)** focusing on local ciders\. This segmented strategy allows Himkok to attract both cocktail connoisseurs and casual crowds, maximizing footfall and revenue\. With capacity for about **450 guests** in total, it functions as both an intimate speakeasy and a high\-energy bar, capturing multiple market segments in Oslo’s nightlife\.

**Brand Prestige and Recognition:** Himkok’s sustained high rankings \(\#10 globally in 2023, \#17 in 2020, etc\.\) are leveraged in its branding and strategy\. Being labeled “one of the world’s best bars” is a powerful marketing tool – especially important in Norway, where direct alcohol advertising is illegal\. Word\-of\-mouth and reputation drive tourist visits and partnerships\. Himkok’s international acclaim also paved the way for strategic **collaborations with global brands** \(e\.g\., **Sony Music Norway for a music\-inspired cocktail menu**\) and invitations to industry events, further solidifying its market positioning as a trendsetter\.

**Growth Approach and Expansion Plans**

**Ready\-to\-Drink Expansion:** A major growth avenue has been Himkok’s push into **RTD cocktails**\. Recognizing the demand for bar\-quality drinks outside the bar, they formulated recipes in\-house and then **partnered with Norway’s oldest brewery, Aass Bryggeri**, to scale production\. This partnership, initiated around 2021, allowed Himkok to **upsell their cocktails in cans nationwide** without needing expensive distilling or canning infrastructure of their own\. By designing the RTDs at **4\.7% ABV**, Himkok tactically sidestepped Norway’s state liquor store monopoly; beverages ≤4\.7% ABV can be sold in regular grocery stores\. This unlocked widespread distribution, getting Himkok’s brand into ~500 retail outlets and even airplanes\. The RTD line’s success \(gold awards for Oslo Mule &amp; Paloma\) suggests continued focus here, potentially including **international exports** once they are confident in supply chain and demand stability\.

**New Distillery Projects:** Expansion for Himkok isn’t just about more bars; it’s about deepening the product offering\. One ambitious project is a **state\-of\-the\-art whiskey distillery in northern Norway**\. By venturing into Norwegian single malt whisky, Himkok aims to enter the global spirits market\. This location up north is strategic: cooler climates and pure water sources can create distinctive whisky profiles \. While details are scant, it indicates a long\-term growth plan where Himkok evolves into a craft spirits brand, not just a bar\. We can expect significant capital investment here, likely via reinvested profits or bank financing, as the whiskey project would require facilities beyond the Oslo bar\.

**New Venues and Ventures:** Erk Potur’s expansion strategy also includes opening new nightlife venues\. The World’s 50 Best Bars article hints at **“Oslo will soon have a new nightclub”** once Himkok’s operating hours end each night\. This likely refers to a separate concept \(possibly under Goldie Bar &amp; Scene AS, which Potur leads\) to capture late\-night crowds\. By diversifying into nightclubs, brewpubs \(Crowbar’s legacy\), and even a tea lounge \(Potur is involved in Goldie&#x2F;Tea Lounge\), the business mitigates risk – if one concept faces headwinds, others can buoy the overall portfolio\. Each new venture leverages shared resources and knowledge but targets a unique market niche\.

**Cautious Global Expansion:** Despite its accolades, Himkok is measured about expanding internationally\. The team is *“in no rush”* for exporting their RTDs or opening overseas outposts\. They acknowledge that one misstep can damage the brand and that Norway’s bar scene is relatively small, so **international moves must be carefully planned**\. For now, the approach is to strengthen the foundation – improve current operations \(“not resting on laurels”\), continue collaborations across art, fashion, and other industries to keep the brand fresh , and test scalability via products\. If a low\-risk opportunity arises \(e\.g\., pop\-ups or partnerships in other countries\), Himkok might pursue it, but the strategy clearly favors sustainable, organic growth over rapid franchising\.

**Partnerships and Collaborations**

**Brewery Partnership:** The collaboration with **Aass Brewery** is a cornerstone of Himkok’s recent expansion\. By working with Aass \(est\. 1834\), Himkok gained access to brewing facilities and distribution networks\. Aass helps **produce and can Himkok’s cocktails at scale**, ensuring quality control as the recipes are “tested and perfected by Himkok’s bartenders and upscaled by Aass”\. This partnership is symbiotic: Aass diversifies into the trendy cocktail market, and Himkok sidesteps capacity limitations of their small in\-bar distillery\. The result – **Himkok’s RTDs on grocery shelves** – enhances brand presence and revenue without massive capital outlay by Himkok\.

**Cultural Collaborations:** Himkok actively collaborates beyond the drinks industry to elevate its brand\. They engage in a *yearly campaign of collaborations with art and culture sectors* \. For instance, in 2023, they partnered with fashion designer **Eline Dragesund** to create a fashion line inspired by their cocktails, culminating in a full runway show\. These cross\-industry projects \(fashion, music, art\) generate buzz and position Himkok as an innovator at the intersection of cocktails and culture\. Another example is the **Sony Music Norway partnership** for a “Beats &amp; Sips” menu blending music and mixology\. Such partnerships deepen their storytelling and attract diverse customers, while also opening up sponsorship or co\-marketing opportunities \(though financial details of these collaborations aren’t public\)\.

**Supplier and Local Partnerships:** Himkok’s commitment to localism means strong ties with Norwegian producers\. They’ve collaborated with **LINIE Aquavit**, Norway’s famed aquavit brand, to launch a limited edition spirit \(Himkok LINIE aquavit\)\. This collaboration not only celebrates Norwegian heritage but also piggybacks on LINIE’s distribution for broader reach\. Additionally, the bar works closely with small producers like **Bybi \(local honey\)** for ingredients\. These partnerships secure high\-quality inputs, often at negotiated rates, and allow co\-branding \(suppliers are credited on menus\)\. It’s a strategic way to manage costs while reinforcing the bar’s narrative of being a farm\-to\-glass pioneer\.

**Industry and Community Involvement:** On the industry front, Himkok engages with bartender networks and sustainability platforms\. They often host or participate in **guest shifts and bar takeovers** globally, which builds goodwill and brand awareness\. The **Himkok team’s presence at competitions and industry talks** \(such as Tales of the Cocktail or Bar Convent events\) also fosters collaborations and knowledge exchange\. Locally, Himkok has been involved in community initiatives \(e\.g\., the Sparebank 1 Østlandet sustainability prize saw a Himkok affiliate recognized\), underscoring a collaborative ethos with the community\. These efforts, while not directly financial, strengthen stakeholder relationships crucial for long\-term success\.

**Financial Sustainability and Cost Structure**

**Cost Management:** Operating a bar in Oslo is costly – from labor \(Norway has high wages\) to alcohol taxes and strict regulations\. Himkok’s cost structure reflects these challenges and their solutions:

 • **Production Costs:** In\-house spirit production is intentionally **not about cost\-saving** but quality control\. As Maroš Dzurus notes, producing spirits internally costs them roughly **€18\-€19 per liter** \(US$19\-20\) – *“not particularly affordable, even for Norway”*\. Yet, they pursue it to tailor flavors and get immediate guest feedback, which is invaluable for product development\. Essentially, they accept higher COGS \(cost of goods sold\) in spirits for a better guest experience and unique offerings\.

 • **Operational Efficiency:** Himkok has innovated to cut costs and waste in other areas\. For example, their shift from fresh pressed juices for high\-volume cocktails to pre\-processed ingredients in KeyKeg cocktails reduced labor and waste\. They cited pressing hundreds of liters of citrus as unsustainable both financially and ecologically, leading them to reformulate recipes for efficiency\. Now, batched cocktails in kegs and RTDs mean lower variable costs per drink \(no on\-demand juicing, less spoilage\)\.

 • **Regulatory Navigation:** Norway’s state alcohol monopoly \(Vinmonopolet\) could limit sales of higher ABV products, so Himkok crafted a lineup at 4\.7% ABV to sell broadly\. This not only expanded their market but also avoids the higher taxation and distribution fees associated with stronger alcohol\. By playing in the “beer category,” they incur standard beer excise taxes, which are lower per unit of alcohol than spirits taxes, helping margins on RTDs\.

 • **Labor and Retention:** A significant cost for any bar is staffing, and high turnover can exacerbate training costs\. Himkok counteracts this by **investing in staff welfare and sustainability culture**, leading to longer employee tenures\. Head bartender Sebastian Sandvik emphasizes that their sustainability efforts \(closed\-loop systems, empowerment in practices\) *“enhanced team spirit, and people stayed longer”*\. Better retention means lower recruitment&#x2F;training costs and a seasoned team that can operate efficiently\.

**Financial Sustainability:** Himkok’s strategy shows a balance between **innovation and prudence**\. They are ambitious in projects but cautious in execution\. Statements like *“one mistake and it’s all over”* regarding expansionreflect a keen awareness of financial risks\. With modest net margins \(~4%\), they aren’t over\-leveraging the company\. The organic growth \(reinvesting earnings into new ventures like the whiskey distillery or nightclub\) suggests sustainable scaling\. Moreover, diversification \(bar sales, RTDs, consulting\) spreads risk and provides fallback revenue if on\-site sales dip\.

Norway’s supportive business environment also aids sustainability\. During tough times \(e\.g\., pandemic closures\), government support schemes and the inherent financial solidity of top bars helped avoid insolvency\. Post\-crisis, pent\-up demand and Himkok’s strong brand propelled a quick recovery, with 2022 and 2023 being record years in terms of awards and presumably revenues\.

**Investment History:** There’s no public record of major external investments in Himkok, which appears largely self\-funded\. The initial investment \(building the bar and distillery in a historic building\) likely came from Potur and possibly bank loans, given it took two years just to get government approval and safety compliance \(like installing bullet\-proof glass around the still\)\. Subsequent expansions \(like RTD production and new venues\) seem to be funded through **operational cash flows and partnerships**\. For instance, the RTD venture capitalized on Aass Brewery’s facilities rather than building their own canning plant – an efficient use of partner’s capital\. The new whiskey distillery might be the first time we see a significant capital injection; however, it could involve joint ventures or Norway’s public support for regional development \(if classified as a tourism or cultural project\)\. As of now, the **financial approach is conservative**: grow with what you have, innovate to create value, and partner to share costs\.

**Funding Sources and Investor Relations**

**Self\-Funding and Loans:** Himkok’s expansion to date appears to be primarily self\-funded or supported by traditional financing \(like bank loans\)\. Norway’s banking sector often supports hospitality projects with proven success\. Given Himkok’s accolades and steady cash flow from operations, securing loans for expansions \(e\.g\., equipment financing for distillery or renovations for new venues\) would be feasible\. There’s no evidence of equity fundraising rounds or angel investors, which suggests Potur kept control and avoided outside dilution\.

**Public Grants:** It’s possible that Himkok or its projects benefitted from cultural or innovation grants\. For example, Norway sometimes offers grants for **heritage building refurbishments** \(Himkok is in a 19th\-century listed building\) and **sustainability initiatives**\. Winning awards like the Ketel One Sustainable Bar Award gave them recognition, but not direct funding\. However, aligning with government priorities \(sustainability, cultural promotion\) could have indirectly opened doors for supportive policies or minor grants\. There’s no specific citation of grants, so this remains speculative, but Himkok’s model is often upheld as a **case study by industry groups and media** \(Trivec’s blog, Campari Academy, etc\.\), which sometimes come with sponsorships for showcasing their story\.

**Investor Relations:** With no external investors, formal investor relations \(IR\) are minimal\. Instead, **stakeholder relations** focus on the community, employees, and partners\. For instance, their communications often highlight how they value employees \(to retain talent\) and how they work with local suppliers \(to build trust and perhaps extended payment terms\)\. If someday Himkok seeks investors \(say, to franchise globally or massively scale production\), their strong brand and clear vision would be attractive\. Until then, Potur’s autonomy allows quick decision\-making and maintaining the bar’s identity without investor pressure\.

**Financial Transparency:** While privately held companies in Norway must file annual reports, they aren’t as readily accessible as public company reports\. However, the **Proff&#x2F;Brønnøysund** records give a snapshot of financial health, which we’ve used here\. These show a positive equity and manageable debt \(in 2023, equity ~NOK 2\.136m vs\. debt NOK 20\.617m\)\. The debt\-to\-equity ratio \(~9\.7\) is high, but typical for a hospitality business where upfront investment \(debt\-financed\) is paid down by operations\. The fact that Himkok has positive net results and equity suggests creditors are being paid and the company is solvent\.

Himkok’s **focus on “financial longevity” as part of sustainability** implies they prioritize staying debt\-resilient and profitable\. They treat financial stability as equal to environmental and social sustainability\. This philosophy bodes well for investor confidence \(should they ever seek it\) because it shows disciplined financial stewardship alongside creative expansion\.

**Conclusion and Outlook**

**Business Model Summary:** Himkok operates a multifaceted business model: a world\-class cocktail bar that vertically integrates a micro\-distillery, bolstered by product extensions \(canned cocktails\) and knowledge\-based services \(consultancy\)\. This model lets them capture value at multiple points – in\-bar sales with high margins for bespoke cocktails, retail sales through RTDs, and B2B services through consulting and events\. Their unwavering commitment to Norwegian cultural ingredients and sustainability not only differentiates them but has also built a loyal customer base and team\.

**Strategic Position:** As of 2024&#x2F;2025, Himkok is well\-positioned as a leader in the cocktail industry, both in Norway and internationally\. They balance **innovation with pragmatism**: for every bold new venture \(like whiskey distilling or NFT cocktail menus\), there’s a calculated strategy \(like focusing on 4\.7% ABV for wide distribution, or holding off exports until ready\)\. The bar’s rise to \#10 in the world isn’t just a vanity metric – it has tangible business benefits in terms of tourism and partnership opportunities\. Being in Oslo \(a smaller market\) means they can’t rely on volume alone, so they’ve mastered maximizing value per customer and extending the brand beyond the bar’s walls\.

**Growth Prospects:** Looking ahead, Himkok’s main growth will likely come from **scaling product sales \(RTDs, bottled spirits\)** and **possibly replicating the bar concept abroad via consulting or partnerships**\. The upcoming whiskey distillery could position them as producers of premium Norwegian whisky, unlocking a new revenue stream in a few years \(whisky needs aging, so 3\-5 years lead time\)\. Domestically, the new nightclub and any other venues will enrich their Oslo stronghold, perhaps making a Himkok\-led group that covers the spectrum from early evening cocktails to late\-night dancing – capturing customer spending across a full night out\.

**Risks and Challenges:** Key challenges include navigating Norway’s strict alcohol marketing laws \(which they’ve done well via word\-of\-mouth and PR\), managing scale \(ensuring quality and brand prestige aren’t diluted as they produce more RTDs or open new spots\), and handling economic swings \(luxury bars can be sensitive to downturns, though Norway’s economy is stable\)\. Additionally, international competition is growing; sustaining a top\-10 bar status will require continuous creativity to stay ahead of global trends\.

In summary, Himkok exemplifies a modern hospitality business that blends craftsmanship with savvy business acumen\. Financially, it maintains healthy performance in a tough market by diversifying income and controlling costs where possible\. Strategically, it grows through partnerships and innovation, all while staying true to its ethos\. This balance of tradition and innovation, local roots and global recognition, bodes well for Himkok’s continued success and financial sustainability in the years to come\.
