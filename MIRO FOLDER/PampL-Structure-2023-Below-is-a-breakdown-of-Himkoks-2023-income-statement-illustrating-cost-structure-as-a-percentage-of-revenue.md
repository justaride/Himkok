\(**Note:** Labor includes salaries, benefits, and employer taxes; “Other Op Costs” include occupancy \(rent\), utilities, marketing, admin, etc\. Financial income in 2023 was unusually high due to a one\-time gain of ~NOK 1\.5m【8†L123\-L131】\.\)

**Labor and Overhead:** At 37\.3% of revenue, **personnel costs** are the largest expense\. This ratio is somewhat above the industry benchmark \(restaurant&#x2F;bar labor ~30%【61†L15\-L23】\), reflecting both Norway’s high wage levels and Himkok’s service model\. With ~38 employees \(full\-time equivalent\)【5†L123\-L130】, profit per employee is about NOK 78k, which is reasonable for the sector\. Notably, 2022’s labor ratio was similar \(35\.3%\), indicating consistent staffing efficiency\. Himkok provides a high\-touch experience \(table service in the Distillery Bar, a doorman for speakeasy entry, etc\.\), so labor costs will remain relatively fixed\. They do flex scheduling seasonally – e\.g\. hiring extra part\-time staff for summer when the courtyard is open and reducing hours in Jan&#x2F;Feb when demand dips\. **Other operating costs \(29\.1%\)** include rent for the multi\-floor venue, utilities \(the distillery equipment and large ice production program consume significant energy\), maintenance, and marketing\. Himkok’s rent in central Oslo is substantial \(roughly estimated at 5–6% of revenue\), while its marketing spend is modest \(relying on earned media from awards\)\. The **prime cost** \(COGS \+ labor\) in 2023 was ~65\.1%, which is slightly above the recommended &lt;60% for restaurants【61†L1\-L9】, but acceptable for a bar that invests heavily in staff quality\.

**Segment Profitability:** In terms of **contribution margin**, Himkok’s signature cocktails likely out\-earn classics\. Original creations often use house\-made ingredients at lower cost and command premium pricing, yielding perhaps 5–10 percentage points higher contribution margin than standard recipes\. For example, a signature aquavit\-based cocktail may have a pour cost of 15% vs\. a classic using an imported spirit at 20% cost\. Management monitors cocktail\-level margins and has noted that adjusting recipes \(e\.g\. switching citrus juices, using seasonal local ingredients\) improved both cost efficiency and sustainability【27†L357\-L365】【27†L373\-L381】\. The move to tap cocktails upstairs also increases the **contribution margin per drink** due to speed \(higher volume per bartender\) and reduced waste\.

**EBITDA &amp; Net Margins:** Himkok’s **EBITDA** has grown in absolute terms over time, but margins remain tight\. EBITDA in 2023 was ≈NOK 2\.8m \(~5\.8% margin\), down slightly from ~NOK 3\.6m \(7\.7%\) in 2022 \(which benefited from some remaining subsidies\)\. Pre\-pandemic, EBITDA margins were likely in the 10–15% range during peak years, but expansion costs and higher fixed expenses \(distillery, larger team\) have compressed these\. **EBIT margin at 4%** is low for a single\-unit business, but the positive net financial items boosted net margin to 6\.2%\. Over **the past 5 years**, EBITDA margin ranged roughly from negative in 2020 \(when COVID closures drove a loss despite government support\) to a high of ~14% in 2021 \(when support funds inflated income\)\. Specifically, EBITDA evolution was approximately: 2019 ~NOK 3\.0m \(~12%\), 2020 around breakeven or slight loss, 2021 ~NOK 3\.58m \(14% with grants\)【6†L99\-L107】【8†L115\-L123】, 2022 ~NOK 3\.57m \(7\.7%\), 2023 ~NOK 2\.8m \(5\.8%\)\. The trend reflects **initial high profitability that was reinvested, a pandemic dip, and a recovery to moderate margins**\. Management expects EBITDA to improve going forward as RTD scales \(providing incremental profit with low overhead\) and as the new whiskey distillery eventually contributes\.

**Profit per Segment:** While exact segment profits aren’t disclosed, we can infer: the **bar operations likely generate the bulk of EBITDA**, albeit absorbed by high labor\. The distillery’s financial benefit is twofold – internal cost savings \(improving bar margins\) and external sales \(modest profit\)\. The RTD line, still in growth phase, likely operated near break\-even in year 1 after marketing and launch costs, but is trending toward profitability as volumes grow\. Any **consulting revenue** would have near\-100% margin, adding directly to the bottom line\. One metric, **profit per seat**, is roughly NOK 6,580 annually \(net profit NOK 2\.96m divided by ~450 capacity\) – a figure that could improve if fixed costs are spread over more business\.

**Benchmark Comparison:** Himkok’s gross margin ~72% is typical for a top bar \(for context, upscale cocktail venues often have 70–80% gross margins on drinks\)\. Its **EBITDA margin ~6%** is lower than some peers; for instance, a highly efficient bar might reach 10–15% EBITDA margin, but many hospitality businesses in Nordics have single\-digit margins\. Compared to **global craft distilleries**, which often have 50–60% gross margins and need scale for profits, Himkok’s integrated approach yields respectable profitability on a smaller scale\. Also, relative to the **Nordic hospitality average net margin \(~2–4%\)**, Himkok’s 6\.2% net margin is slightly above average, indicating decent profitability despite its heavy cost base【5†L83\-L91】\.

In summary, **Himkok is profitable but not overly so**, converting only a small share of its high revenues into profit due to high quality\-cost tradeoffs\. The business prioritizes quality \(labor, ingredients, R&amp;D\) and brand value, which keep margins modest\. Going forward, attention to cost control \(e\.g\. optimizing staff levels on quieter nights, negotiating better ingredient procurement as volumes rise\) could lift margins\. Additionally, as debt servicing grows \(if interest rates rise\), improving operating margin to &gt;10% will be important to maintain healthy net profits\.

## Operational Financial Metrics

**Inventory Turnover:** Himkok maintains inventory of both **spirits and perishables**, including base liquor \(potato neutral spirit, botanicals\), bottled products, and bar ingredients\. In 2023, ending inventory was NOK 2\.927m【8†L191\-L199】\. With COGS of NOK 13\.331m【6†L101\-L109】, the inventory turnover ratio is about **4\.6 times per year**, meaning the average inventory is sold&#x2F;used in ~80 days\. This turnover rate is moderate: perishable stock \(citrus, herbs, etc\.\) turns much faster \(days or weeks\), while spirits and RTD cans may sit longer\. The distillery likely holds some aging aquavit and experimental batches, which slows overall turnover\. By comparison, a typical bar might target 6\-8x turnover for consumables, but Himkok’s stock includes **aging inventory \(whiskey barrels, vermouth\-cask aquavit\)** which is intentional long\-term holding\. Excluding aging stock, their effective turnover for bar supplies is higher and healthy\. They have implemented inventory management to minimize waste – for example, moving to kegged cocktails reduced the need to stockpile fresh juices \(they now use processed inputs, improving shelf\-life\)【27†L355\-L364】\. Also, producing spirits in\-house means they keep raw materials \(grains&#x2F;potatoes, etc\.\) and finished spirit inventory, which ties up capital but ensures supply\. Overall, inventory management appears efficient, with no indication of excessive overstock\. The company’s slight inventory build in 2023 \(\+111k NOK\) suggests preparing for growth \(perhaps stocking more RTD cans or ingredients\)\.

**Cash Conversion Cycle:** Himkok’s **cash conversion cycle \(CCC\)** is on the order of a couple of months, influenced by its mix of cash and credit sales\. The bar operates mostly on **cash&#x2F;credit card sales** – customers pay immediately, so **Days Sales Outstanding \(DSO\)** for bar revenue is effectively 0\. However, the RTD and bottle sales introduce receivables\. Accounts receivable at end\-2023 were NOK 714k【8†L193\-L201】, which likely corresponds to invoices to Aass Brewery or other wholesale clients\. Given the RTD sales volume \(say ~NOK 7m&#x2F;year\), **DSO for RTD** might be around 30–45 days \(typical net\-30 terms to distributors\)\. On a weighted basis, the overall DSO is low \(the majority of revenue is immediate\)\. **Days Inventory Outstanding \(DIO\)** is about 80 days as noted\. **Days Payable Outstanding \(DPO\)** was ~47 days in 2023 \(Accounts payable NOK 1\.699m vs\. average daily COGS ~36\.5k\)【10†L239\-L247】\. Himkok likely benefits from standard supplier credit terms \(30 days for beverage suppliers, etc\.\), and possibly longer terms from some vendors\. Notably, they owed NOK 2\.410m in public taxes \(VAT, alcohol duties\) at year\-end【10†L241\-L249】, which indicates timing of tax payments also affects cash flow\. Combining these, the **cash conversion cycle** ≈ DIO \+ DSO – DPO\. Using the RTD\-adjusted view: ~80 \+ ~40 – ~47 = ~73 days\. But for the core bar business \(cash sales\), CCC is closer to ~30 days \(inventory 80 – payables 47, since no receivables\)\. This means it takes roughly 1–2 months for cash spent on inventory to return as revenue cash\. The CCC is reasonable for a business carrying aging inventory\. As RTD grows, receivables will increase, but Himkok can manage this by leveraging Aass’s distribution \(perhaps Aass handles retailer payments and remits to Himkok, reducing Himkok’s credit risk\)\. So far, receivables are small relative to sales \(1\.5% of 2023 revenue\), indicating efficient cash collection\.

**Days Sales Outstanding \(RTD\):** Specifically for RTD, if we assume stores pay Aass and Aass pays Himkok monthly, the **DSO might be ~30 days**\. If Himkok bills Aass on delivery of batches, the DSO could vary with production cycles\. There were no signs of major payment delays – receivables actually fell slightly from 2022 to 2023 \(from 971k to 714k\)【8†L193\-L201】, even as RTD sales grew, implying good collections\. This efficient DSO aids liquidity\.

**Pour Cost % \(Cocktails\):** Himkok’s average **pour cost** \(the cost of ingredients in a drink relative to its price\) is estimated around **20%** for cocktails, which aligns with industry targets【60†L9\-L17】\. For instance, a cocktail priced at NOK 150 might have ~NOK 30 worth of spirits, mixers, and garnish\. Himkok’s innovative use of local&#x2F;farm ingredients and house spirits helps control pour cost\. Some drinks likely run even lower pour cost \(e\.g\. a gin cocktail using their own gin and seasonal syrup could be &lt;15% cost\)\. Beer&#x2F;wine have higher pour costs \(beer ~30%, wine by glass ~35%\), but are a smaller share of sales\. The overall beverage cost \(all drinks\) in 2023 was 27\.8%【6†L101\-L109】, which suggests a **blended pour cost in the high 20s%**\. This is slightly elevated; likely factors include the RTD production costs counted in COGS and potentially some waste or cost on less profitable items\. Nonetheless, a &lt;28% cost of goods is respectable\. The **industry norm** for cocktail bars is to keep pour costs below 25% for liquor and below 30% overall【60†L9\-L17】\. Himkok is in range, and management’s focus on sustainability has reduced waste \(thus effectively lowering real pour cost\)\. For example, by reusing ingredients and eliminating citrus waste, they improved cost efficiency【27†L357\-L365】\. Pour cost variance is monitored by weekly inventory counts – any deviation \(e\.g\. overpouring or theft\) would raise COGS\. The consistent gross margin suggests tight control here\.

**Labor Cost % and Seasonality:** **Labor cost** was 37% of revenue in 2023 \(and 35% in 2022\)【6†L107\-L110】\. This ratio does fluctuate seasonally\. In low\-revenue months \(Jan–Feb\), labor as % can temporarily spike &gt;50%, as staff are retained despite slower sales\. Himkok mitigates this by a flexible staffing model: many employees are part\-time or students who can have reduced shifts in slow periods\. Conversely, in peak summer, they bring on extra staff but revenue rises proportionally, keeping the labor% in check\. On busy nights, table service at the main bar means a relatively high staff\-to\-guest ratio, but the high ATV justifies it\. The **productivity \(revenue per employee\)** was ~NOK 1\.26m in 2023, above the hospitality sector average\. This indicates efficient staff utilization given the multi\-bar operation\. **Staff turnover rate** \(an important operational metric\) isn’t given, but retaining skilled bartenders is crucial for consistency and avoiding new training costs\. As a Worlds 50 Best Bar, Himkok likely invests in staff training and pays above\-average wages \(contributing to its high labor cost % but ensuring quality\)\.

**Table Turnover Rate:** In the Distillery Bar \(ground floor\), where seating is limited and experience is lengthier, table turnover might be ~1\.5 to 2 turns per evening \(a guest party might stay 2\+ hours\)\. On the high\-volume floor and courtyard, turnover is higher – people come and go more frequently, perhaps 3–4\+ turns per night at those stations \(especially for quick draft cocktails or the cider bar\)\. The **overall table turnover** might average ~2\.5 per night across all seating\. This metric correlates with revenue: efforts to increase turnover \(without compromising experience\) can raise RevPASH\. For instance, implementing a reservation time limit in the Distillery Bar or encouraging earlier happy\-hour visits could add an extra turn on some tables\. However, as a high\-end bar, Himkok must balance turnover with guest satisfaction; they won’t rush guests just to flip tables\. Currently, the mix of spaces \(a relaxed lounge vs\. a faster\-paced tap bar\) naturally optimizes turnover where appropriate\. If anything, the **bottleneck for revenue is capacity utilization** – on peak nights, they often reach full capacity \(with a queue outside\), meaning every seat and standing space is monetized\. On slower nights, turnover is not the constraint, demand is\. Thus, management’s focus is on driving traffic on off\-peak times \(e\.g\. special mid\-week events\) rather than squeezing more turns on full nights\.

In operational metrics, **Himkok performs well**: inventory is reasonably lean for a bar\-distillery, cash cycle is manageable with most sales in cash, and cost ratios are within expected ranges given the concept\. The main operational challenge is managing high fixed costs \(labor, rent\) against variable seasonal sales – which they handle via staffing flexibility and maintaining a financial buffer\. Additionally, the emerging RTD business introduces a production&#x2F;distribution aspect, which they’ve handled through partnership to avoid operational strain\. Continued vigilance on pour costs \(to prevent any slippage\) and on staff productivity \(training staff to multitask across bars\) will support profitability\. Overall, the operational metrics indicate a well\-run venue with attention to efficiency without compromising the product\.

## Capital Structure &amp; Investment Analysis

**Debt Breakdown \(NOK 20\.617m\):** Himkok’s balance sheet is debt\-heavy, with **total liabilities of NOK 20\.617 million** against NOK 22\.753m in assets \(2023\)【9†L1\-L4】\. The **debt composition** is as follows:

- **Long\-Term Debt:** NOK 9\.651m classified as “Annen langsiktig gjeld” \(other long\-term debt\)【10†L235\-L243】\. This likely represents bank loans or owner loans used to fund major investments \(renovations, distillery equipment, RTD project\)\. There is no specific “Gjeld til kredittinstitusjoner” listed, suggesting the debt might not be a traditional bank loan, or is grouped under other debt\. It could be a loan from the parent company \(Something Local AS\) or a government\-backed loan \(Innovation Norway, which sometimes supports craft distilleries\)\. The presence of pledged collateral of NOK 6\.000m in 2022【10†L255\-L263】 hints that part of this debt is secured – possibly a bank loan of ~6 million NOK taken around 2021 to support the RTD expansion or venue upgrades\. The remaining long\-term debt could be an intercompany loan or bond\. **Interest terms:** The 2023 accounts show only NOK 85k in interest expense【8†L131\-L139】, implying an average interest rate of ~0\.9% on the long\-term debt – this seems low, so it’s likely much of the LT debt is interest\-free shareholder loans or favorable\-rate loans\. If a bank loan exists, perhaps it was at 3–5% interest but only drawn part of the year or partially repaid\.
- **Short\-Term Debt:** NOK 10\.967m in current liabilities【10†L247\-L251】\. Key components: **Accounts Payable** NOK 1\.699m【10†L239\-L247】 \(to suppliers for spirits, brewing ingredients, etc\.\), **Taxes Payable** NOK 2\.410m【10†L241\-L249】 \(VAT and payroll taxes accrued\), **Intercompany Payable** NOK 3\.881m【10†L243\-L250】 \(short\-term debt to parent or related parties\), and **Other Accrued Liabilities** NOK 2\.977m【10†L243\-L250】 \(e\.g\. salaries due, holiday pay, etc\.\)\. The short\-term **group debt of NOK 3\.881m** suggests the parent company or a sister company provided a cash advance or short\-term loan \(perhaps to fund working capital or a specific project\)\. This might carry little or no interest\. The rest of current debt are normal operating payables\.

In total, about **NOK 13\.532m** of the debt is interest\-bearing \(if we sum long\-term 9\.651m \+ assume perhaps ~3\.88m group loan might have interest\)\. The remainder are non\-interest obligations \(AP, taxes\)\. The average interest rate is low \(~1–2%\), which suggests either subsidized loans or a capital structure where owners prefer internal financing over bank debt\. Given Norway’s rising interest rates by 2024, the company might face higher costs if any floating\-rate bank loans exist, but the small interest cost in 2023 implies minimal exposure so far\.

**Terms &amp; Maturity:** While specific loan terms aren’t public, we can infer that any long\-term bank loan \(if present\) might have been a **5\-year term loan** taken in 2021 when the new company was formed \(the timing aligns with large asset investments and 6m collateral\)\. If so, maturity could be around 2026 with annual amortizations\. Interest likely around NIBOR \+ margin \(perhaps ~3–4% effective in 2021–22, rising in 2023\)\. The collateral indicates it’s secured by some business assets \(possibly the distilling equipment or even owner’s property\)\. The **intercompany debts** probably have no fixed maturity \(payable on demand or when cash allows\)\. The parent \(Something Local AS\) even received a group contribution of NOK ~1\.996m in 2022【8†L159\-L164】, which suggests some of the intercompany balance could be a way to upstream cash\. It’s likely the parent is financially supporting expansions \(such as the upcoming whiskey distillery investment\) – possibly by injecting cash as needed\.

**Capital Investments:** Himkok’s growth has been fueled by **significant capital investments** in recent years:

- **Initial Venue Fit\-Out \(2015\):** The original setup of the bar and micro\-distillery would have required investment in a copper still, bar build\-out, furniture, etc\. This may have been on the order of a few million NOK\. \(The NP Bygg reference suggests a NOK 14\.3m renovation cost, possibly for expanding the site in 2019【57†L13\-L16】\.\)
- **2021–2022 Investments:** The balance sheet shows fixed assets jumping from NOK 3\.463m \(2021\) to 9\.572m \(2022\)【8†L171\-L179】, and financial assets from NOK 0\.662m to 6\.935m【8†L189\-L197】\. This indicates **over NOK 12m invested** in that period\. Key uses: scaling up the RTD production \(formulation, initial production runs, possibly funding Aass partnership\), and likely starting the **whiskey distillery project**\. In the Jigger Daily interview \(Jan 2025\), Paul Voza mentions *“we’re building a distillery in the north of the country to produce whisky”*【32†L137\-L145】\. It’s plausible that in 2022 the company allocated several million NOK as capital or loans into that project \(which might be structured as a subsidiary or separate entity, hence showing as financial fixed assets\)\. The whiskey distillery \(in Finnmark or similar remote area\) will require construction of facilities, equipment, and working capital for aging stock\. If even a pilot, a decent investment \(≥ NOK 5–10m\) is needed\. Indeed, plans to put “Norwegian single malts on the map” were underway【37†L193\-L200】\.
- **Distillery Equipment Payback:** The on\-site 180L copper pot still \(and associated gear\) was a key early investment\. The **payback period** on that distillery equipment can be roughly assessed: It enabled savings on liquor purchases \(perhaps NOK 1–2m&#x2F;year\) and generated some bottle sales revenue\. If the still cost ~NOK 1–2m, the payback could have been about **2–3 years**\. By now, that equipment has likely **paid for itself**, evident in the lower depreciation expense by 2023 \(depreciation fell as assets fully depreciated\)【8†L111\-L119】\.
- **RTD Production Line ROI:** Notably, Himkok did *not* buy a full canning line or brewery – instead, they partnered with Aass Brewery which already has production capacity【27†L359\-L367】\. This smart strategy means the **ROI on the RTD initiative is high**, as Himkok’s capital outlay was minimal \(mainly R&amp;D, branding, and maybe financing inventory\)\. The RTD line essentially monetizes Himkok’s recipes on a mass scale with Aass handling manufacturing&#x2F;distribution\. Whatever funds Himkok put into developing this \(perhaps some hundreds of thousands in product development and initial inventory\), it was likely recouped in the first year of sales given the strong uptake \(top seller on Norwegian airlines, etc\.【26†L25\-L33】\)\. If we treat the RTD partnership as an “investment”, its ROI could be exceptional – e\.g\., even a NOK 1m investment yielding ~NOK 1m in profit annually once mature would be a 100% ROI\. Currently, RTD profits might still be modest as they reinvest in marketing, but as volumes grow, ROI will climb\. It’s also an **asset\-light expansion**, which is ideal given Himkok’s limited equity\.
- **ROIC by Segment:** Return on invested capital for the bar segment is high, as it’s an operating business with minimal working capital\. The distillery segment’s ROIC is harder to parse but likely moderate: the small distillery itself probably generates a few million in revenue on maybe a NOK ~3–4m net asset base \(pot still, etc\.\), giving perhaps ~15–25% ROIC\. The RTD segment’s ROIC, as noted, could become very high due to low asset base\. If we include the pending whiskey distillery, that will initially *drag* ROIC down – whiskey production ties up capital in barrels that won’t generate revenue for years\. However, if successful, the whiskey venture could eventually produce healthy returns\. For now, overall **ROIC** \(return on invested capital\) for the company can be approximated: EBIT 1\.988m plus adjust for tax gives NOPAT ~1\.54m; invested capital \(equity \+ interest\-bearing debt\) ~ \(2\.136m equity \+ ~13\.5m debt\) ≈ 15\.6m\. That yields ROIC ~9\.9%\. This is slightly above the company’s cost of capital \(estimated ~6%, see WACC below\), indicating value creation, albeit not dramatically high yet due to recent heavy investments\.

**Weighted Average Cost of Capital \(WACC\):** Himkok’s WACC is relatively low thanks to its heavy debt weighting\. With ~91% debt and 9% equity, and considering debt is cheap \(1–4%\) and equity in a small private firm might expect ~15% return, we estimate **WACC ≈5–6%**\. For example, using 5% cost of debt \(a conservative assumption for future interest rates\) and 15% cost of equity: WACC = \(0\.91*5%\)*\(1\- tax rate 22%\) \+ 0\.09\*15% ≈ 4\.55%\*0\.78 \+ 1\.35% = ~4\.8% \(after\-tax\) \+ 1\.35% = **~6\.2%**\. If much of the debt is quasi\-equity \(owner loans\), the true WACC might be higher\. Nonetheless, the current capital mix lowers WACC\. This helps justify leveraging – as long as they can earn ROIC above ~5–6%, they increase equity value\. However, high leverage also raises financial risk \(discussed in Risk Profile\)\. Management might consider rebalancing the capital structure \(e\.g\. retaining earnings to boost equity or converting some debt to equity\) to ensure long\-term stability\.

**Future Capital Needs:** The major looming investment is the **whisky distillery up north**\. This will be capital intensive – building a “state\-of\-the\-art” facility to put Norwegian single malt on the global map【37†L193\-L200】\. If this is undertaken by Himkok’s company \(or a subsidiary\), it could require tens of millions NOK over the next few years \(land, equipment, warehouses, operating expenses while whiskey ages\)\. Likely, external investors or loans will be sought to fund it, as Himkok’s balance sheet alone can’t easily absorb it\. The plan may be to secure local funding or grants \(perhaps from regional development programs\) – especially since remote distilleries like Myken and others have navigated similar paths\. Any such move will alter the capital structure significantly and must be weighed against current obligations\. **Payback period for the whisky distillery** will be long \(whisky must age ≥3 years, realistically 5–10 years for premium single malt\)\. We project the payback period could be ~8–10 years after launch, given initial negative cash flows and then potential strong sales if the product succeeds\.

In summary, **Himkok’s capital structure is aggressive but has fueled growth**\. The company smartly leveraged debt and partnerships to expand its product lines without diluting founder ownership\. Investments in the bar and micro\-distillery have already paid off in brand equity and savings; the RTD venture shows early signs of high return; the upcoming whiskey project is a bet that could yield long\-term rewards\. Prudent management of debt \(ensuring interest costs remain manageable and maturities are staggered\) will be crucial\. Currently, debt service is low\-cost, but any tightening in credit or additional borrowing for the whisky expansion will necessitate careful cash planning or an injection of new equity capital\.
