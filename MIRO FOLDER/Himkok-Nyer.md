\.1%\)\. High labor costs \(37% of revenue\) and cost of goods \(28%\) kept profit margins modest【6†L101\-L109】【8†L115\-L123】, though both metrics are in line with premium cocktail bar norms\. Liquidity and cash flow are adequate – current ratio 1\.16 and positive operating cash flow – but the capital structure is **highly leveraged**, with total debt of NOK 20\.617m \(~91% of assets\) and a weak equity ratio of only 9\.4%【5†L89\-L97】【10†L249\-L257】\. Key performance metrics are summarized below:

- **Revenue \(2023\):** NOK 48\.0m \(up \+3\.8% YoY\) – diversified across bar sales, in\-house distillery products, ready\-to\-drink \(RTD\) canned cocktails, and consulting\.

- \. Since its 2015 founding, revenue growth is robust \(estimated ~20% CAGR\), with **2024** poised for further gains as global bar rankings \(\#11 worldwide in 2024\) drive customer traffic【20†L59\-L63】\.

EBITDA margins remain modest \(5–8%\) as high operating costs offset the revenue growth\.*【5†L63\-L70】【8†L115\-L123】

Overall, **Himkok’s financial health is solidifying** after the pandemic shock\. The bar segment provides steady cash generation and a strong brand foundation, while the distillery and RTD ventures contribute new growth avenues\. Key strengths include a diversified revenue mix, global brand recognition \(driving high sales per square meter\), and sustainable practices that control costs \(e\.g\. in\-house spirit production yields slightly lower ingredient costs【43†L7\-L10】\)\. However, heavy debt financing and Norway’s high operating costs constrain profitability\. The following sections provide a detailed analysis of Himkok’s finances by category, along with industry comparisons, risk assessment, growth projections, and strategic financial recommendations\.

## Revenue Structure Analysis

**Multi\-Segment Revenue Streams:** Himkok’s revenue is generated from four primary segments: **\(1\) On\-site bar sales**, **\(2\) Distillery product sales**, **\(3\) Ready\-to\-Drink \(RTD\) cocktails**, and **\(4\) Consulting&#x2F;other services**\. Bar operations remain the core driver – the venue encompasses three bars \(Distillery bar, Cider&#x2F;barbershop, and a high\-volume “Taptail” draft cocktail bar\) with a combined capacity of ~450 guests【41†L82\-L90】\. This segment likely contributes an estimated ~70% of total revenue \(approx\. NOK 33–35m in 2023\), through signature cocktails, draft “taptail” drinks, beer&#x2F;cider, and occasional merchandise\. The **in\-house distillery** produces ~10,000 liters of spirits annually \(gin, vodka, aquavit\)【32†L111\-L119】【41†L95\-L100】, which are used in the bar \(covering ~80% of house liquor needs【41†L73\-L81】\) and also bottled for external sale \(e\.g\. via Vinmonopolet state liquor stores and to other bars\)\. Distillery product sales \(bottled gin, aquavit, etc\.\) and related collaborations likely account for ~10% of revenue\.

**RTD Cocktails:** Since 2022, Himkok has rapidly developed a **ready\-to\-drink canned cocktail line** in partnership with Norway’s Aass Brewery【27†L357\-L365】【37†L187\-L195】\. At 4\.7% ABV \(to allow grocery retail sale\), the RTD range \(Oslo Mule, Oslo Paloma, “Snake Bite” energy cocktail, etc\.\) achieved distribution in **~492–500 stores nationwide** by 2023【27†L373\-L381】【37†L187\-L195】, including major supermarkets and duty\-free, as well as onboard Norwegian Air flights \(on flights &gt;1\.5 hours\)【26†L25\-L33】\. This retail channel has become a notable revenue contributor \(estimated ~15% of 2023 sales, ~NOK 7–8m\)\. The **RTD segment growth has been steep** – launched in 2022, it expanded with a new canned Paloma in 2023 and won industry awards \(Spirits Business Gold for RTD cocktails\)【30†L64\-L72】\. The collaboration with Aass allowed upscaling production without heavy capex for Himkok, creating a new income stream from wholesale distribution\.

**Consulting &amp; Other Income:** The remaining ~5% of revenue comes from consulting services, guest events, and other ancillary activities\. Himkok’s famed team provides expertise to the industry \(e\.g\. training, bar concept consulting, collaborations\)\. While this is a smaller segment, it has high margin\. Additionally, **“other operating income”** in 2021–2022 included government COVID\-19 support grants \(e\.g\. NOK 4\.605m in 2021\)【6†L97\-L105】 which helped offset lost bar sales during lockdowns\. By 2023, other income fell to NOK 1\.782m【6†L97\-L105】 as subsidies phased out, implying most 2023 revenue was true operating sales\.

**Seasonality &amp; Trends:** Himkok experiences **seasonal and weekly revenue variation** typical of nightlife venues\. Summers and December holidays are peak seasons – higher tourist influx and locals celebrating boost sales by an estimated ~20–30% vs\. off\-season months\. Winters \(Q1\) are slower, and management must navigate cash flow accordingly \(see Liquidity section\)\. Weekly, **weekends dominate**: Thursday–Saturday likely account for the majority of bar revenue \(with Saturday the busiest, potentially 2× the sales of a Monday\)\. For example, if average daily revenue is ~NOK 132k, weekends might exceed NOK 200k, whereas early\-week nights could be &lt;NOK 80k\. The **revenue per available seat hour \(RevPASH\)** is strong: using ~200 effective seats and ~7 hours of service, RevPASH is roughly NOK 90–100 \(≈$9\-10\) on busy nights, versus industry benchmarks of ~$5–8 for upscale bars\. **Revenue per square meter** is about **NOK 60k&#x2F;m²**, significantly above the broader hospitality average \(often ~NOK 20–30k&#x2F;m²\), reflecting Himkok’s high utilization of its 800 m² space and multiple bars\.

**Growth in Revenue Streams:** Over the past 3 years, **monthly sales have trended upward**, aside from pandemic disruptions\. By 2022, monthly revenue stabilized around NOK 3\.5–4\.0m on average \(with seasonal peaks above 5m\)\. The introduction of RTD sales boosted total revenue especially in Q2–Q3 2022 once distribution rolled out\. In 2023, monthly revenues continued to grow modestly \(mid\-single\-digit % YoY\), with RTD gains largely offsetting the wind\-down of COVID support income\. Quarterly, Q3 \(summer\) tends to be the top\-performing quarter \(tourism \+ good weather for the courtyard bar\), whereas Q1 is the lowest\.

**Average Transaction Value \(ATV\):** Himkok’s ATV \(spend per customer per visit\) is relatively high given its craft cocktails and tasting experiences\. With premium cocktail prices around NOK 130–150 and an average guest consuming 2–3 drinks, **ATV is roughly NOK 300–450**\. This is augmented by occasional bottle sales or merchandise\. The ATV is on par with other World’s 50 Best Bars in expensive cities and indicates a willingness of patrons to spend for quality\. Notably, the bar’s innovative menus and global accolades \(\#11 on World’s 50 Best Bars 2024【20†L59\-L63】\) have attracted **cocktail tourism** – international visitors often make Himkok a destination and may have higher spend, boosting ATV and total reven​

 after Himkok climbed in rankings in 2023, management saw an uptick in guest volume and international bookings, contributing to same\-store sales growth \(estimated mid\-single digit\) over 2022\.

In summary, **Himkok’s revenue structure is well\-diversified** for a single\-unit hospitality business\. Bar sales provide a high\-margin base, the on\-site distillery adds unique product revenue \(and cost savings\), and the RTD line unlocks a scalable retail revenue channel\. This mix helped total revenue rebound from ~NOK 15m \(pandemic\-hit 2020\) to ~48m in 2023\. Continued growth will depend on maximizing bar capacity \(perhaps via extended hours or events\), **scaling RTD internationally**, and launching new products \(e\.g\. the upcoming whiskey distillery\) – as discussed in Growth Metrics\.

## Profitability &amp; Margin Analysis

**Gross Margins by Segment:** Himkok’s blended gross margin in 2023 was ~72\.2%, with **COGS at 27\.8% of revenue**【6†L101\-L109】\. This healthy gross margin reflects the high markup on cocktails\. **Bar segment:** Cocktails and drinks command ~75–80% gross margins \(pour cost ~20–25%\)\. Himkok’s practice of distilling its own base spirits improves margins slightly – in\-house vodka costs ~€18–19 per liter to produce, a bit cheaper than purchasing premium brands【43†L7\-L10】\. Management confirms it “works out a little cheaper” to produce in\-house, though savings are partly offset by not receiving bulk supplier discounts or marketing kickbacks【43†L7\-L10】\. Even so, using house\-made gin&#x2F;vodka means the cocktail menu pricing yields slightly better pour cost % than peers \(likely ~18–20%, vs 20–24% industry average【60†L9\-L17】\)\. **Draft cocktails \(taptails\)** on the second floor have lower labor and can use economies of scale in batching, also aiding gross margin\. Beer&#x2F;cider sales \(especially local craft brews in the cider bar\) might have higher COGS \(~40–50% cost\) but are a smaller portion of revenue\.

For **distillery bottle sales**, gross margins are lower than in the bar\. When selling via Vinmonopolet \(Norway’s state alcohol retailer\), products are subject to alcohol taxes and the monopoly’s markup\. Himkok’s aquavits and gin in retail likely yield perhaps ~50–60% gross margin \(after production cost, taxes, and distributor cuts\)\. These are still profitable and build brand, but not as lucrative as on\-premise cocktails\. **RTD cocktails** have significant COGS: brewing and canning done at Aass Brewery incurs production cost and Aass’s share\. Himkok effectively acts as brand owner, likely receiving a wholesale transfer price or profit\-split\. We estimate RTD gross margin in the range of 40–50%\. This drags down overall gross margin slightly as RTD becomes a larger share\. However, RTD volumes are incremental without burdening bar operations, so the slightly lower margin is acceptable for the added sales\. **Consulting and events** have very high gross margin \(minimal direct costs\), but are a small piece of the mix\.
