# Himkok Oslo: Business Model, Growth Strategy, and Market Positioning

**1\. Introduction**

Himkok, translating to &quot;moonshine&quot; in Norwegian, has established itself as a prominent institution in Oslo&#39;s hospitality scene\. Founded in 2015, it has garnered international acclaim, consistently ranking among the world&#39;s top bars, including holding the coveted \#1 position on the Top 500 Bars list in 2024\. This report aims to provide a comprehensive analysis of Himkok&#39;s business model, growth strategy, and market positioning within the competitive Oslo market, drawing upon available information to understand the key factors contributing to its success\.

**2\. Business Model**

Himkok operates a multifaceted business model centered around a commitment to Norwegian culture, sustainability, and in\-house production\. Its core offerings extend beyond a traditional bar, encompassing a fully functioning distillery, multiple bar concepts within the venue, and a growing consultancy service\.

**2\.1\. Revenue Streams and Core Offerings**

The primary revenue streams for Himkok are generated through the sale of expertly crafted cocktails and the spirits distilled on\-site\. The venue houses three distinct bar areas: a downstairs cocktail bar providing table service with a high\-end experience, an upstairs bar featuring cocktails on tap for a more festive atmosphere, and a summer cider bar exclusively serving local ciders in a relaxed outdoor setting\. This multi\-faceted approach allows Himkok to cater to a diverse clientele and various occasions\.

A significant aspect of Himkok&#39;s business model is its on\-site distillery, which produces the majority \(around 80\-85%\) of the spirits used in their cocktails, including Aquavit, Gin, and Vodka\. This in\-house production provides a unique selling proposition and allows for greater control over the quality and flavor profiles of their offerings\. Furthermore, it aligns with their strong sustainability ethos by eliminating the transportation of bottles and ingredients, thereby reducing their carbon footprint\.

Beyond the physical bar experience, Himkok has diversified its revenue streams through several strategic initiatives\. In 2022, they launched a range of ready\-to\-drink \(RTD\) cocktails in cans, made with their own distilled spirits and drawing on Norwegian natural ingredients\. Initially available only in Norway, there are plans for future expansion\. Additionally, in mid\-2024, Himkok introduced amateur and professional cocktail courses, leveraging their expertise to educate and engage with the public\. They also offer consultancy services, drawing on their experience as a world\-renowned bar to assist other hospitality businesses with menu development, staff training, and operational guidance\.

**2\.2\. Operational Structure and Sustainability Focus**

Himkok&#39;s operational structure is deeply intertwined with its commitment to sustainability\. They have implemented a &quot;full\-circular system&quot; where approximately 85% of their offerings are produced in\-house, minimizing waste and environmental impact\. This includes using leftover potatoes from a local farmer to produce distilled ethanol and sourcing honey from local bee farms on rooftops\. They avoid using citrus fruits due to long transportation distances and utilize straws made from organic materials\. The bar menu itself is made from recycled waste\.

This dedication to sustainability extends to employee engagement\. Himkok involves all employees in their sustainability work, holding monthly meetings to discuss their circular model\. This fosters a sense of shared values and has contributed to long\-term employee retention\. The focus on local sourcing also involves building strong relationships with suppliers, who are even mentioned on the menu, fostering trust and potentially leading to cost savings in the long run\. Himkok&#39;s proactive approach to environmental responsibility earned them the prestigious &quot;Most Sustainable Bar&quot; award in 2018, further solidifying their reputation as a leader in the bar world\.

**3\. Growth Strategy**

Himkok&#39;s growth strategy is characterized by a focus on innovation, expansion of its product portfolio, and strategic partnerships, all while staying true to its core values of Norwegian culture and sustainability\.

**3\.1\. History and Evolution**

Founded in 2015 by Erk Potur, Himkok emerged from a vision to create a bar centered on Norwegian flavors, origin, and culture, with a particular emphasis on Aquavit, the Scandinavian national spirit\. Potur, a veteran of Oslo&#39;s cocktail and pub scene, aimed to push the boundaries of the traditional bar concept by integrating a distillery on\-site, similar to his previous venture, Crowbar, which featured its own brewery\. The location in Storgata 27, a building with a history dating back to the late 1800s as an industrial warehouse for pharmacy appliances, was carefully chosen\. This historical connection is reflected in the bartenders&#39; white lab coats and the bar&#39;s logo, paying homage to the building&#39;s past and the historical link between pharmacies and cocktail origins\.

Despite initial challenges, including the dilapidated state of the building and strict regulations surrounding alcohol in Norway, Himkok persevered, becoming the first distillery bar in Oslo\. Their commitment to showcasing Norwegian produce and supporting the local community quickly gained recognition\. This dedication, coupled with consistently high\-quality cocktails and service, propelled Himkok onto the global stage, entering The World&#39;s 50 Best Bars list in 2016 at number 42\. Their ascent continued, reaching the top 20 in 2020 and achieving their highest ranking of number 10 in 2023, earning them the Nikka Highest Climber Award\. This consistent recognition on a global scale significantly enhances their reputation, attracts international clientele, and validates their business model and offerings\.

Key milestones in Himkok&#39;s evolution include receiving the Ketel One Sustainable Bar Award in 2018, which provided significant validation for their sustainability efforts and further strengthened their brand identity\. In 2022, they strategically entered the RTD market, diversifying their revenue streams and allowing them to reach a wider consumer base beyond their physical location, especially important during and after pandemic\-related closures\. Mid\-2024 saw the launch of cocktail courses, creating a new revenue stream, enhancing their reputation as experts, and fostering a community around their brand\. Furthermore, they developed consultancy services, allowing them to monetize their knowledge and experience, further diversifying their revenue streams and establishing them as industry leaders\.

**3\.2\. Expansion Plans**

Himkok has ambitious plans for future growth, focusing on expanding its production capabilities and market reach\. Recognizing the limitations of their current small distillery, they are actively exploring options to increase their spirit production capacity\. The desire to increase production suggests growing demand for their spirits, both internally for their bar and externally for their RTD line and potential wholesale\. Exploring exports indicates a significant ambition to expand their brand reach and tap into international markets\.

A significant long\-term investment is the development of a state\-of\-the\-art whisky distillery in the north of the country\. This project signals a commitment to expanding their product portfolio and entering a new segment of the spirits market\. The focus on the unique terroir of Northern Norway, particularly its pure water, suggests a strategy to create distinctive, high\-quality whiskies that can stand out in the global market\.

In Oslo, Himkok plans to open a new nightclub after the bar closes for the night\. This represents a diversification into a related but distinct segment of the nightlife industry, potentially leveraging their existing customer base and brand recognition to cater to a broader range of evening entertainment needs\.

**3\.3\. Partnerships and Collaborations**

Strategic partnerships and collaborations have played a crucial role in Himkok&#39;s growth\. They have cultivated long\-term relationships with local farmers and producers for essential ingredients like potatoes and honey, which reinforces their sustainability narrative, ensures high\-quality, fresh ingredients, and supports the local economy\. These suppliers are even acknowledged on their menu\.

Their collaboration with Aass Brewery, one of Norway&#39;s oldest and largest breweries, to produce their RTD cocktails provided access to established production and distribution infrastructure, enabling a faster and more efficient entry into the retail market\. A unique partnership with the Norwegian Aquavit brand Linie involved aging Himkok&#39;s aquavit at sea for six months, adding an interesting and premium offering to their Aquavit portfolio, leveraging Linie&#39;s established aging process\.

Himkok also engages in yearly campaigns with different sectors of art and culture, such as fashion\. These collaborations serve as innovative marketing strategies to promote their brand and reach new audiences in a market with strict alcohol advertising regulations, allowing them to build brand awareness and engagement creatively\.

**4\. Market Positioning and Target Audience**

Himkok has strategically positioned itself as a leader in the premium cocktail market, emphasizing its Norwegian heritage, commitment to sustainability, and exceptional quality\.

**4\.1\. Marketing and Branding**

The name &quot;Himkok&quot; and its association with &quot;moonshine&quot; or &quot;homemade&quot; creates a memorable and intriguing brand identity that resonates with both locals and tourists seeking an authentic Norwegian experience\. They actively promote the use of local ingredients and showcase Norwegian culture through their cocktails and spirits, catering to a growing interest in local and sustainable products and providing a unique selling proposition in the international cocktail scene\.

Sustainability is a core message in their branding and operations, prominently featured to resonate with environmentally conscious consumers and enhance their brand image as a responsible and forward\-thinking establishment\. Their consistently high ranking in The World&#39;s 50 Best Bars is actively communicated to build credibility and attract customers, serving as a powerful marketing tool for both local and international cocktail enthusiasts seeking a world\-class experience\.

To navigate Norway&#39;s strict alcohol advertising laws, Himkok utilizes creative and thematic menus, such as &quot;Beats &amp; Sips,&quot; as a way to promote themselves indirectly through art, music, and other cultural references, allowing them to engage with customers and build brand awareness innovatively\.

**4\.2\. Customer Perception**

Customer reviews consistently praise the quality and innovation of Himkok&#39;s cocktails and the professionalism and friendliness of their staff\.

Himkok aims to cater to a diverse clientele, reflected in their multi\-room venue and varied offerings, allowing them to maximize their potential customer base and adapt to different occasions and preferences\. Despite Oslo&#39;s reputation for high prices, some reviews suggest Himkok offers excellent value for the quality provided, reinforcing the quality of their offerings and justifying the cost for customers\.

**4\.3\. Unique Selling Propositions**

Himkok&#39;s success can be attributed to several unique selling propositions\. Being Oslo&#39;s only bar\-distillery producing their own spirits on\-site provides a significant competitive advantage by offering exclusive, house\-made spirits and a unique &quot;farm\-to\-glass&quot; experience\. Their strong focus on Norwegian ingredients and flavors appeals to both locals and tourists seeking an authentic taste of the region\.

Their deeply integrated sustainability practices resonate with a growing segment of environmentally aware consumers and enhance their brand reputation\.

Himkok&#39;s average cocktail price aligns with the premium segment of the Oslo market, similar to Svanen\. This suggests that Himkok is positioned as a high\-quality establishment without being significantly more expensive than its direct competitors in this category\.

A key differentiator for Himkok is its unique selling propositions, particularly its on\-site distillery and strong emphasis on sustainability, which sets it apart from most competitors, including highly\-regarded bars like Svanen\. While Svanen is lauded for its ambiance and cocktails, it lacks the in\-house distillery and the same level of commitment to sustainability that defines Himkok\. Andre Til Høyre and Pier 42 appear to offer cocktails at a slightly lower average price point, indicating a potential focus on a different customer segment or occasion\.

**6\. Oslo Hospitality Market Context**

Understanding the broader Oslo hospitality market is crucial to contextualize Himkok&#39;s success and future prospects\.

**6\.1\. Overview of the Oslo Bar and Restaurant Scene**

Oslo&#39;s bar and restaurant scene has matured significantly, gaining international recognition, as exemplified by Himkok&#39;s global standing\. The tourism sector in Norway is experiencing robust growth, with hotel guest nights reaching record highs, including a notable increase in 2024\. This positive trend in tourism benefits establishments like Himkok that attract both local and international visitors\. Furthermore, there is a growing emphasis on sustainability within Norway, making Himkok&#39;s eco\-conscious approach particularly relevant and appealing to consumers\. Norway was recognized as the world&#39;s most sustainable country in 2020\. Emerging concerns about overtourism could potentially lead to increased regulation of short\-term rentals and fees on overnight stays, which might indirectly benefit established hotels and bars like Himkok by potentially limiting the growth of informal competition\.

**6\.2\. Impact of Regulations**

Norway&#39;s stringent regulations on alcohol advertising, in place since 1975, significantly impact how establishments like Himkok can market themselves\. This necessitates the adoption of creative and indirect marketing strategies, such as Himkok&#39;s conceptual menus and cultural collaborations\. Himkok&#39;s continued success despite these limitations underscores the strength of its brand reputation and its reliance on word\-of\-mouth marketing\.

**6\.3\. Market Performance**

Hotel revenues in Oslo continue to grow in 2024, although at a more moderate pace compared to the substantial post\-pandemic recovery seen in 2023\. Interestingly, overall alcohol sales in Norway reached a four\-year low in 2023, with volume declines across beer, wine, and spirits, while soft drink sales increased\. This suggests a potential shift in consumer preferences or spending habits within the Norwegian alcohol market\. However, despite the decrease in volume, Norway leads in alcohol per capita expenditure among Nordic countries, with projections indicating continued growth in expenditure\. This implies that while consumers may be drinking less, they are increasingly opting for higher\-quality alcoholic beverages, a trend that aligns favorably with Himkok&#39;s premium positioning\. The global premium spirits market is also experiencing growth, driven by factors such as rising disposable incomes and evolving consumer preferences\. This global trend supports Himkok&#39;s expansion into spirit production and potential exports, indicating a positive market environment for their premium offerings\.

**7\. Conclusion**

Himkok Oslo has established a strong and successful business model centered on its identity as a bar and on\-site distillery with a deep commitment to Norwegian culture and sustainability\. Its growth strategy, marked by innovation, product diversification into RTDs and whisky, and strategic partnerships, positions it for continued success\. Himkok&#39;s market positioning as a premium, world\-renowned cocktail bar with unique offerings resonates well with its target audience and allows it to stand out in the competitive Oslo hospitality scene\. While navigating the regulatory landscape and adapting to evolving consumer preferences in the broader alcohol market will be crucial, Himkok&#39;s established reputation, unique selling propositions, and proactive approach to growth suggest a promising future both within Oslo and potentially on the international stage\.
