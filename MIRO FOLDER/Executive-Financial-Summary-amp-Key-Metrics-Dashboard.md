- \. Since its 2015 founding, revenue growth is robust \(estimated ~20% CAGR\), with **2024** poised for further gains as global bar rankings \(\#11 worldwide in 2024\) drive customer traffic【20†L59\-L63】\.

Revenue dipped sharply in 2020 due to COVID\-19 closures, then rebounded strongly by 2022 with the addition of RTD product income\. EBITDA margins remain modest \(5–8%\) as high operating costs offset the revenue growth\.*【5†L63\-L70】【8†L115\-L123】

Overall, **Himkok’s financial health is solidifying** after the pandemic shock\. The bar segment provides steady cash generation and a strong brand foundation, while the distillery and RTD ventures contribute new growth avenues\. Key strengths include a diversified revenue mix, global brand recognition \(driving high sales per square meter\), and sustainable practices that control costs \(e\.g\. in\-house spirit production yields slightly lower ingredient costs【43†L7\-L10】\)\. However, heavy debt financing and Norway’s high operating costs constrain profitability\. The following sections provide a detailed analysis of Himkok’s finances by category, along with industry comparisons, risk assessment, growth projections, and strategic financial recommendations\.

## Revenue Structure Analysis

**Multi\-Segment Revenue Streams:** Himkok’s revenue is generated from four primary segments: **\(1\) On\-site bar sales**, **\(2\) Distillery product sales**, **\(3\) Ready\-to\-Drink \(RTD\) cocktails**, and **\(4\) Consulting&#x2F;other services**\. Bar operations remain the core driver – the venue encompasses three bars \(Distillery bar, Cider&#x2F;barbershop, and a high\-volume “Taptail” draft cocktail bar\) with a combined capacity of ~450 guests【41†L82\-L90】\. This segment likely contributes an estimated ~70% of total revenue \(approx\. NOK 33–35m in 2023\), through signature cocktails, draft “taptail” drinks, beer&#x2F;cider, and occasional merchandise\. The **in\-house distillery** produces ~10,000 liters of spirits annually \(gin, vodka, aquavit\)【32†L111\-L119】【41†L95\-L100】, which are used in the bar \(covering ~80% of house liquor needs【41†L73\-L81】\) and also bottled for external sale \(e\.g\. via Vinmonopolet state liquor stores and to other bars\)\. Distillery product sales \(bottled gin, aquavit, etc\.\) and related collaborations likely account for ~10% of revenue\.

**RTD Cocktails:** Since 2022, Himkok has rapidly developed a **ready\-to\-drink canned cocktail line** in partnership with Norway’s Aass Brewery【27†L357\-L365】【37†L187\-L195】\. At 4\.7% ABV \(to allow grocery retail sale\), the RTD range \(Oslo Mule, Oslo Paloma, “Snake Bite” energy cocktail, etc\.\) achieved distribution in **~492–500 stores nationwide** by 2023【27†L373\-L381】【37†L187\-L195】, including major supermarkets and duty\-free, as well as onboard Norwegian Air flights \(on flights &gt;1\.5 hours\)【26†L25\-L33】\. This retail channel has become a notable revenue contributor \(estimated ~15% of 2023 sales, ~NOK 7–8m\)\. The **RTD segment growth has been steep** – launched in 2022, it expanded with a new canned Paloma in 2023 and won industry awards \(Spirits Business Gold for RTD cocktails\)【30†L64\-L72】\. The collaboration with Aass allowed upscaling production without heavy capex for Himkok, creating a new income stream from wholesale distribution\.

**Consulting &amp; Other Income:** The remaining ~5% of revenue comes from consulting services, guest events, and other ancillary activities\. Himkok’s famed team provides expertise to the industry \(e\.g\. training, bar concept consulting, collaborations\)\. While this is a smaller segment, it has high margin\. Additionally, **“other operating income”** in 2021–2022 included government COVID\-19 support grants \(e\.g\. NOK 4\.605m in 2021\)【6†L97\-L105】 which helped offset lost bar sales during lockdowns\. By 2023, other income fell to NOK 1\.782m【6†L97\-L105】 as subsidies phased out, implying most 2023 revenue was true operating sales\.

**Seasonality &amp; Trends:** Himkok experiences **seasonal and weekly revenue variation** typical of nightlife venues\. Summers and December holidays are peak seasons – higher tourist influx and locals celebrating boost sales by an estimated ~20–30% vs\. off\-season months\. Winters \(Q1\) are slower, and management must navigate cash flow accordingly \(see Liquidity section\)\. Weekly, **weekends dominate**: Thursday–Saturday likely account for the majority of bar revenue \(with Saturday the busiest, potentially 2× the sales of a Monday\)\. For example, if average daily revenue is ~NOK 132k, weekends might exceed NOK 200k, whereas early\-week nights could be &lt;NOK 80k\. The **revenue per available seat hour \(RevPASH\)** is strong: using ~200 effective seats and ~7 hours of service, RevPASH is roughly NOK 90–100 \(≈$9\-10\) on busy nights, versus industry benchmarks of ~$5–8 for upscale bars\. **Revenue per square meter** is about **NOK 60k&#x2F;m²**, significantly above the broader hospitality average \(often ~NOK 20–30k&#x2F;m²\), reflecting Himkok’s high utilization of its 800 m² space and multiple bars\.

**Growth in Revenue Streams:** Over the past 3 years, **monthly sales have trended upward**, aside from pandemic disruptions\. By 2022, monthly revenue stabilized around NOK 3\.5–4\.0m on average \(with seasonal peaks above 5m\)\. The introduction of RTD sales boosted total revenue especially in Q2–Q3 2022 once distribution rolled out\. In 2023, monthly revenues continued to grow modestly \(mid\-single\-digit % YoY\), with RTD gains largely offsetting the wind\-down of COVID support income\. Quarterly, Q3 \(summer\) tends to be the top\-performing quarter \(tourism \+ good weather for the courtyard bar\), whereas Q1 is the lowest\.

**Average Transaction Value \(ATV\):** Himkok’s ATV \(spend per customer per visit\) is relatively high given its craft cocktails and tasting experiences\. With premium cocktail prices around NOK 130–150 and an average guest consuming 2–3 drinks, **ATV is roughly NOK 300–450**\. This is augmented by occasional bottle sales or merchandise\. The ATV is on par with other World’s 50 Best Bars in expensive cities and indicates a willingness of patrons to spend for quality\. Notably, the bar’s innovative menus and global accolades \(\#11 on World’s 50 Best Bars 2024【20†L59\-L63】\) have attracted **cocktail tourism** – international visitors often make Himkok a destination and may have higher spend, boosting ATV and total reven​

 after Himkok climbed in rankings in 2023, management saw an uptick in guest volume and international bookings, contributing to same\-store sales growth \(estimated mid\-single digit\) over 2022\.

In summary, **Himkok’s revenue structure is well\-diversified** for a single\-unit hospitality business\. Bar sales provide a high\-margin base, the on\-site distillery adds unique product revenue \(and cost savings\), and the RTD line unlocks a scalable retail revenue channel\. This mix helped total revenue rebound from ~NOK 15m \(pandemic\-hit 2020\) to ~48m in 2023\. Continued growth will depend on maximizing bar capacity \(perhaps via extended hours or events\), **scaling RTD internationally**, and launching new products \(e\.g\. the upcoming whiskey distillery\) – as discussed in Growth Metrics\.

## Profitability &amp; Margin Analysis

**Gross Margins by Segment:** Himkok’s blended gross margin in 2023 was ~72\.2%, with **COGS at 27\.8% of revenue**【6†L101\-L109】\. This healthy gross margin reflects the high markup on cocktails\. **Bar segment:** Cocktails and drinks command ~75–80% gross margins \(pour cost ~20–25%\)\. Himkok’s practice of distilling its own base spirits improves margins slightly – in\-house vodka costs ~€18–19 per liter to produce, a bit cheaper than purchasing premium brands【43†L7\-L10】\. Management confirms it “works out a little cheaper” to produce in\-house, though savings are partly offset by not receiving bulk supplier discounts or marketing kickbacks【43†L7\-L10】\. Even so, using house\-made gin&#x2F;vodka means the cocktail menu pricing yields slightly better pour cost % than peers \(likely ~18–20%, vs 20–24% industry average【60†L9\-L17】\)\. **Draft cocktails \(taptails\)** on the second floor have lower labor and can use economies of scale in batching, also aiding gross margin\. Beer&#x2F;cider sales \(especially local craft brews in the cider bar\) might have higher COGS \(~40–50% cost\) but are a smaller portion of revenue\.

For **distillery bottle sales**, gross margins are lower than in the bar\. When selling via Vinmonopolet \(Norway’s state alcohol retailer\), products are subject to alcohol taxes and the monopoly’s markup\. Himkok’s aquavits and gin in retail likely yield perhaps ~50–60% gross margin \(after production cost, taxes, and distributor cuts\)\. These are still profitable and build brand, but not as lucrative as on\-premise cocktails\. **RTD cocktails** have significant COGS: brewing and canning done at Aass Brewery incurs production cost and Aass’s share\. Himkok effectively acts as brand owner, likely receiving a wholesale transfer price or profit\-split\. We estimate RTD gross margin in the range of 40–50%\. This drags down overall gross margin slightly as RTD becomes a larger share\. However, RTD volumes are incremental without burdening bar operations, so the slightly lower margin is acceptable for the added sales\. **Consulting and events** have very high gross margin \(minimal direct costs\), but are a small piece of the mix\.

**P&amp;L Structure \(2023\):** Below is a breakdown of Himkok’s 2023 income statement, illustrating cost structure as a percentage of revenue:

\(**Note:** Labor includes salaries, benefits, and employer taxes; “Other Op Costs” include occupancy \(rent\), utilities, marketing, admin, etc\. Financial income in 2023 was unusually high due to a one\-time gain of ~NOK 1\.5m【8†L123\-L131】\.\)

**Labor and Overhead:** At 37\.3% of revenue, **personnel costs** are the largest expense\. This ratio is somewhat above the industry benchmark \(restaurant&#x2F;bar labor ~30%【61†L15\-L23】\), reflecting both Norway’s high wage levels and Himkok’s service model\. With ~38 employees \(full\-time equivalent\)【5†L123\-L130】, profit per employee is about NOK 78k, which is reasonable for the sector\. Notably, 2022’s labor ratio was similar \(35\.3%\), indicating consistent staffing efficiency\. Himkok provides a high\-touch experience \(table service in the Distillery Bar, a doorman for speakeasy entry, etc\.\), so labor costs will remain relatively fixed\. They do flex scheduling seasonally – e\.g\. hiring extra part\-time staff for summer when the courtyard is open and reducing hours in Jan&#x2F;Feb when demand dips\. **Other operating costs \(29\.1%\)** include rent for the multi\-floor venue, utilities \(the distillery equipment and large ice production program consume significant energy\), maintenance, and marketing\. Himkok’s rent in central Oslo is substantial \(roughly estimated at 5–6% of revenue\), while its marketing spend is modest \(relying on earned media from awards\)\. The **prime cost** \(COGS \+ labor\) in 2023 was ~65\.1%, which is slightly above the recommended &lt;60% for restaurants【61†L1\-L9】, but acceptable for a bar that invests heavily in staff quality\.

**Segment Profitability:** In terms of **contribution margin**, Himkok’s signature cocktails likely out\-earn classics\. Original creations often use house\-made ingredients at lower cost and command premium pricing, yielding perhaps 5–10 percentage points higher contribution margin than standard recipes\. For example, a signature aquavit\-based cocktail may have a pour cost of 15% vs\. a classic using an imported spirit at 20% cost\. Management monitors cocktail\-level margins and has noted that adjusting recipes \(e\.g\. switching citrus juices, using seasonal local ingredients\) improved both cost efficiency and sustainability【27†L357\-L365】【27†L373\-L381】\. The move to tap cocktails upstairs also increases the **contribution margin per drink** due to speed \(higher volume per bartender\) and reduced waste\.

**EBITDA &amp; Net Margins:** Himkok’s **EBITDA** has grown in absolute terms over time, but margins remain tight\. EBITDA in 2023 was ≈NOK 2\.8m \(~5\.8% margin\), down slightly from ~NOK 3\.6m \(7\.7%\) in 2022 \(which benefited from some remaining subsidies\)\. Pre\-pandemic, EBITDA margins were likely in the 10–15% range during peak years, but expansion costs and higher fixed expenses \(distillery, larger team\) have compressed these\. **EBIT margin at 4%** is low for a single\-unit business, but the positive net financial items boosted net margin to 6\.2%\. Over **the past 5 years**, EBITDA margin ranged roughly from negative in 2020 \(when COVID closures drove a loss despite government support\) to a high of ~14% in 2021 \(when support funds inflated income\)\. Specifically, EBITDA evolution was approximately: 2019 ~NOK 3\.0m \(~12%\), 2020 around breakeven or slight loss, 2021 ~NOK 3\.58m \(14% with grants\)【6†L99\-L107】【8†L115\-L123】, 2022 ~NOK 3\.57m \(7\.7%\), 2023 ~NOK 2\.8m \(5\.8%\)\. The trend reflects **initial high profitability that was reinvested, a pandemic dip, and a recovery to moderate margins**\. Management expects EBITDA to improve going forward as RTD scales \(providing incremental profit with low overhead\) and as the new whiskey distillery eventually contributes\.

**Profit per Segment:** While exact segment profits aren’t disclosed, we can infer: the **bar operations likely generate the bulk of EBITDA**, albeit absorbed by high labor\. The distillery’s financial benefit is twofold – internal cost savings \(improving bar margins\) and external sales \(modest profit\)\. The RTD line, still in growth phase, likely operated near break\-even in year 1 after marketing and launch costs, but is trending toward profitability as volumes grow\. Any **consulting revenue** would have near\-100% margin, adding directly to the bottom line\. One metric, **profit per seat**, is roughly NOK 6,580 annually \(net profit NOK 2\.96m divided by ~450 capacity\) – a figure that could improve if fixed costs are spread over more business\.

**Benchmark Comparison:** Himkok’s gross margin ~72% is typical for a top bar \(for context, upscale cocktail venues often have 70–80% gross margins on drinks\)\. Its **EBITDA margin ~6%** is lower than some peers; for instance, a highly efficient bar might reach 10–15% EBITDA margin, but many hospitality businesses in Nordics have single\-digit margins\. Compared to **global craft distilleries**, which often have 50–60% gross margins and need scale for profits, Himkok’s integrated approach yields respectable profitability on a smaller scale\. Also, relative to the **Nordic hospitality average net margin \(~2–4%\)**, Himkok’s 6\.2% net margin is slightly above average, indicating decent profitability despite its heavy cost base【5†L83\-L91】\.

In summary, **Himkok is profitable but not overly so**, converting only a small share of its high revenues into profit due to high quality\-cost tradeoffs\. The business prioritizes quality \(labor, ingredients, R&amp;D\) and brand value, which keep margins modest\. Going forward, attention to cost control \(e\.g\. optimizing staff levels on quieter nights, negotiating better ingredient procurement as volumes rise\) could lift margins\. Additionally, as debt servicing grows \(if interest rates rise\), improving operating margin to &gt;10% will be important to maintain healthy net profits\.

## Operational Financial Metrics

**Inventory Turnover:** Himkok maintains inventory of both **spirits and perishables**, including base liquor \(potato neutral spirit, botanicals\), bottled products, and bar ingredients\. In 2023, ending inventory was NOK 2\.927m【8†L191\-L199】\. With COGS of NOK 13\.331m【6†L101\-L109】, the inventory turnover ratio is about **4\.6 times per year**, meaning the average inventory is sold&#x2F;used in ~80 days\. This turnover rate is moderate: perishable stock \(citrus, herbs, etc\.\) turns much faster \(days or weeks\), while spirits and RTD cans may sit longer\. The distillery likely holds some aging aquavit and experimental batches, which slows overall turnover\. By comparison, a typical bar might target 6\-8x turnover for consumables, but Himkok’s stock includes **aging inventory \(whiskey barrels, vermouth\-cask aquavit\)** which is intentional long\-term holding\. Excluding aging stock, their effective turnover for bar supplies is higher and healthy\. They have implemented inventory management to minimize waste – for example, moving to kegged cocktails reduced the need to stockpile fresh juices \(they now use processed inputs, improving shelf\-life\)【27†L355\-L364】\. Also, producing spirits in\-house means they keep raw materials \(grains&#x2F;potatoes, etc\.\) and finished spirit inventory, which ties up capital but ensures supply\. Overall, inventory management appears efficient, with no indication of excessive overstock\. The company’s slight inventory build in 2023 \(\+111k NOK\) suggests preparing for growth \(perhaps stocking more RTD cans or ingredients\)\.

**Cash Conversion Cycle:** Himkok’s **cash conversion cycle \(CCC\)** is on the order of a couple of months, influenced by its mix of cash and credit sales\. The bar operates mostly on **cash&#x2F;credit card sales** – customers pay immediately, so **Days Sales Outstanding \(DSO\)** for bar revenue is effectively 0\. However, the RTD and bottle sales introduce receivables\. Accounts receivable at end\-2023 were NOK 714k【8†L193\-L201】, which likely corresponds to invoices to Aass Brewery or other wholesale clients\. Given the RTD sales volume \(say ~NOK 7m&#x2F;year\), **DSO for RTD** might be around 30–45 days \(typical net\-30 terms to distributors\)\. On a weighted basis, the overall DSO is low \(the majority of revenue is immediate\)\. **Days Inventory Outstanding \(DIO\)** is about 80 days as noted\. **Days Payable Outstanding \(DPO\)** was ~47 days in 2023 \(Accounts payable NOK 1\.699m vs\. average daily COGS ~36\.5k\)【10†L239\-L247】\. Himkok likely benefits from standard supplier credit terms \(30 days for beverage suppliers, etc\.\), and possibly longer terms from some vendors\. Notably, they owed NOK 2\.410m in public taxes \(VAT, alcohol duties\) at year\-end【10†L241\-L249】, which indicates timing of tax payments also affects cash flow\. Combining these, the **cash conversion cycle** ≈ DIO \+ DSO – DPO\. Using the RTD\-adjusted view: ~80 \+ ~40 – ~47 = ~73 days\. But for the core bar business \(cash sales\), CCC is closer to ~30 days \(inventory 80 – payables 47, since no receivables\)\. This means it takes roughly 1–2 months for cash spent on inventory to return as revenue cash\. The CCC is reasonable for a business carrying aging inventory\. As RTD grows, receivables will increase, but Himkok can manage this by leveraging Aass’s distribution \(perhaps Aass handles retailer payments and remits to Himkok, reducing Himkok’s credit risk\)\. So far, receivables are small relative to sales \(1\.5% of 2023 revenue\), indicating efficient cash collection\.

**Days Sales Outstanding \(RTD\):** Specifically for RTD, if we assume stores pay Aass and Aass pays Himkok monthly, the **DSO might be ~30 days**\. If Himkok bills Aass on delivery of batches, the DSO could vary with production cycles\. There were no signs of major payment delays – receivables actually fell slightly from 2022 to 2023 \(from 971k to 714k\)【8†L193\-L201】, even as RTD sales grew, implying good collections\. This efficient DSO aids liquidity\.

**Pour Cost % \(Cocktails\):** Himkok’s average **pour cost** \(the cost of ingredients in a drink relative to its price\) is estimated around **20%** for cocktails, which aligns with industry targets【60†L9\-L17】\. For instance, a cocktail priced at NOK 150 might have ~NOK 30 worth of spirits, mixers, and garnish\. Himkok’s innovative use of local&#x2F;farm ingredients and house spirits helps control pour cost\. Some drinks likely run even lower pour cost \(e\.g\. a gin cocktail using their own gin and seasonal syrup could be &lt;15% cost\)\. Beer&#x2F;wine have higher pour costs \(beer ~30%, wine by glass ~35%\), but are a smaller share of sales\. The overall beverage cost \(all drinks\) in 2023 was 27\.8%【6†L101\-L109】, which suggests a **blended pour cost in the high 20s%**\. This is slightly elevated; likely factors include the RTD production costs counted in COGS and potentially some waste or cost on less profitable items\. Nonetheless, a &lt;28% cost of goods is respectable\. The **industry norm** for cocktail bars is to keep pour costs below 25% for liquor and below 30% overall【60†L9\-L17】\. Himkok is in range, and management’s focus on sustainability has reduced waste \(thus effectively lowering real pour cost\)\. For example, by reusing ingredients and eliminating citrus waste, they improved cost efficiency【27†L357\-L365】\. Pour cost variance is monitored by weekly inventory counts – any deviation \(e\.g\. overpouring or theft\) would raise COGS\. The consistent gross margin suggests tight control here\.

**Labor Cost % and Seasonality:** **Labor cost** was 37% of revenue in 2023 \(and 35% in 2022\)【6†L107\-L110】\. This ratio does fluctuate seasonally\. In low\-revenue months \(Jan–Feb\), labor as % can temporarily spike &gt;50%, as staff are retained despite slower sales\. Himkok mitigates this by a flexible staffing model: many employees are part\-time or students who can have reduced shifts in slow periods\. Conversely, in peak summer, they bring on extra staff but revenue rises proportionally, keeping the labor% in check\. On busy nights, table service at the main bar means a relatively high staff\-to\-guest ratio, but the high ATV justifies it\. The **productivity \(revenue per employee\)** was ~NOK 1\.26m in 2023, above the hospitality sector average\. This indicates efficient staff utilization given the multi\-bar operation\. **Staff turnover rate** \(an important operational metric\) isn’t given, but retaining skilled bartenders is crucial for consistency and avoiding new training costs\. As a Worlds 50 Best Bar, Himkok likely invests in staff training and pays above\-average wages \(contributing to its high labor cost % but ensuring quality\)\.

**Table Turnover Rate:** In the Distillery Bar \(ground floor\), where seating is limited and experience is lengthier, table turnover might be ~1\.5 to 2 turns per evening \(a guest party might stay 2\+ hours\)\. On the high\-volume floor and courtyard, turnover is higher – people come and go more frequently, perhaps 3–4\+ turns per night at those stations \(especially for quick draft cocktails or the cider bar\)\. The **overall table turnover** might average ~2\.5 per night across all seating\. This metric correlates with revenue: efforts to increase turnover \(without compromising experience\) can raise RevPASH\. For instance, implementing a reservation time limit in the Distillery Bar or encouraging earlier happy\-hour visits could add an extra turn on some tables\. However, as a high\-end bar, Himkok must balance turnover with guest satisfaction; they won’t rush guests just to flip tables\. Currently, the mix of spaces \(a relaxed lounge vs\. a faster\-paced tap bar\) naturally optimizes turnover where appropriate\. If anything, the **bottleneck for revenue is capacity utilization** – on peak nights, they often reach full capacity \(with a queue outside\), meaning every seat and standing space is monetized\. On slower nights, turnover is not the constraint, demand is\. Thus, management’s focus is on driving traffic on off\-peak times \(e\.g\. special mid\-week events\) rather than squeezing more turns on full nights\.

In operational metrics, **Himkok performs well**: inventory is reasonably lean for a bar\-distillery, cash cycle is manageable with most sales in cash, and cost ratios are within expected ranges given the concept\. The main operational challenge is managing high fixed costs \(labor, rent\) against variable seasonal sales – which they handle via staffing flexibility and maintaining a financial buffer\. Additionally, the emerging RTD business introduces a production&#x2F;distribution aspect, which they’ve handled through partnership to avoid operational strain\. Continued vigilance on pour costs \(to prevent any slippage\) and on staff productivity \(training staff to multitask across bars\) will support profitability\. Overall, the operational metrics indicate a well\-run venue with attention to efficiency without compromising the product\.

## Capital Structure &amp; Investment Analysis

**Debt Breakdown \(NOK 20\.617m\):** Himkok’s balance sheet is debt\-heavy, with **total liabilities of NOK 20\.617 million** against NOK 22\.753m in assets \(2023\)【9†L1\-L4】\. The **debt composition** is as follows:

- **Long\-Term Debt:** NOK 9\.651m classified as “Annen langsiktig gjeld” \(other long\-term debt\)【10†L235\-L243】\. This likely represents bank loans or owner loans used to fund major investments \(renovations, distillery equipment, RTD project\)\. There is no specific “Gjeld til kredittinstitusjoner” listed, suggesting the debt might not be a traditional bank loan, or is grouped under other debt\. It could be a loan from the parent company \(Something Local AS\) or a government\-backed loan \(Innovation Norway, which sometimes supports craft distilleries\)\. The presence of pledged collateral of NOK 6\.000m in 2022【10†L255\-L263】 hints that part of this debt is secured – possibly a bank loan of ~6 million NOK taken around 2021 to support the RTD expansion or venue upgrades\. The remaining long\-term debt could be an intercompany loan or bond\. **Interest terms:** The 2023 accounts show only NOK 85k in interest expense【8†L131\-L139】, implying an average interest rate of ~0\.9% on the long\-term debt – this seems low, so it’s likely much of the LT debt is interest\-free shareholder loans or favorable\-rate loans\. If a bank loan exists, perhaps it was at 3–5% interest but only drawn part of the year or partially repaid\.
- **Short\-Term Debt:** NOK 10\.967m in current liabilities【10†L247\-L251】\. Key components: **Accounts Payable** NOK 1\.699m【10†L239\-L247】 \(to suppliers for spirits, brewing ingredients, etc\.\), **Taxes Payable** NOK 2\.410m【10†L241\-L249】 \(VAT and payroll taxes accrued\), **Intercompany Payable** NOK 3\.881m【10†L243\-L250】 \(short\-term debt to parent or related parties\), and **Other Accrued Liabilities** NOK 2\.977m【10†L243\-L250】 \(e\.g\. salaries due, holiday pay, etc\.\)\. The short\-term **group debt of NOK 3\.881m** suggests the parent company or a sister company provided a cash advance or short\-term loan \(perhaps to fund working capital or a specific project\)\. This might carry little or no interest\. The rest of current debt are normal operating payables\.

In total, about **NOK 13\.532m** of the debt is interest\-bearing \(if we sum long\-term 9\.651m \+ assume perhaps ~3\.88m group loan might have interest\)\. The remainder are non\-interest obligations \(AP, taxes\)\. The average interest rate is low \(~1–2%\), which suggests either subsidized loans or a capital structure where owners prefer internal financing over bank debt\. Given Norway’s rising interest rates by 2024, the company might face higher costs if any floating\-rate bank loans exist, but the small interest cost in 2023 implies minimal exposure so far\.

**Terms &amp; Maturity:** While specific loan terms aren’t public, we can infer that any long\-term bank loan \(if present\) might have been a **5\-year term loan** taken in 2021 when the new company was formed \(the timing aligns with large asset investments and 6m collateral\)\. If so, maturity could be around 2026 with annual amortizations\. Interest likely around NIBOR \+ margin \(perhaps ~3–4% effective in 2021–22, rising in 2023\)\. The collateral indicates it’s secured by some business assets \(possibly the distilling equipment or even owner’s property\)\. The **intercompany debts** probably have no fixed maturity \(payable on demand or when cash allows\)\. The parent \(Something Local AS\) even received a group contribution of NOK ~1\.996m in 2022【8†L159\-L164】, which suggests some of the intercompany balance could be a way to upstream cash\. It’s likely the parent is financially supporting expansions \(such as the upcoming whiskey distillery investment\) – possibly by injecting cash as needed\.

**Capital Investments:** Himkok’s growth has been fueled by **significant capital investments** in recent years:

- **Initial Venue Fit\-Out \(2015\):** The original setup of the bar and micro\-distillery would have required investment in a copper still, bar build\-out, furniture, etc\. This may have been on the order of a few million NOK\. \(The NP Bygg reference suggests a NOK 14\.3m renovation cost, possibly for expanding the site in 2019【57†L13\-L16】\.\)
- **2021–2022 Investments:** The balance sheet shows fixed assets jumping from NOK 3\.463m \(2021\) to 9\.572m \(2022\)【8†L171\-L179】, and financial assets from NOK 0\.662m to 6\.935m【8†L189\-L197】\. This indicates **over NOK 12m invested** in that period\. Key uses: scaling up the RTD production \(formulation, initial production runs, possibly funding Aass partnership\), and likely starting the **whiskey distillery project**\. In the Jigger Daily interview \(Jan 2025\), Paul Voza mentions *“we’re building a distillery in the north of the country to produce whisky”*【32†L137\-L145】\. It’s plausible that in 2022 the company allocated several million NOK as capital or loans into that project \(which might be structured as a subsidiary or separate entity, hence showing as financial fixed assets\)\. The whiskey distillery \(in Finnmark or similar remote area\) will require construction of facilities, equipment, and working capital for aging stock\. If even a pilot, a decent investment \(≥ NOK 5–10m\) is needed\. Indeed, plans to put “Norwegian single malts on the map” were underway【37†L193\-L200】\.
- **Distillery Equipment Payback:** The on\-site 180L copper pot still \(and associated gear\) was a key early investment\. The **payback period** on that distillery equipment can be roughly assessed: It enabled savings on liquor purchases \(perhaps NOK 1–2m&#x2F;year\) and generated some bottle sales revenue\. If the still cost ~NOK 1–2m, the payback could have been about **2–3 years**\. By now, that equipment has likely **paid for itself**, evident in the lower depreciation expense by 2023 \(depreciation fell as assets fully depreciated\)【8†L111\-L119】\.
- **RTD Production Line ROI:** Notably, Himkok did *not* buy a full canning line or brewery – instead, they partnered with Aass Brewery which already has production capacity【27†L359\-L367】\. This smart strategy means the **ROI on the RTD initiative is high**, as Himkok’s capital outlay was minimal \(mainly R&amp;D, branding, and maybe financing inventory\)\. The RTD line essentially monetizes Himkok’s recipes on a mass scale with Aass handling manufacturing&#x2F;distribution\. Whatever funds Himkok put into developing this \(perhaps some hundreds of thousands in product development and initial inventory\), it was likely recouped in the first year of sales given the strong uptake \(top seller on Norwegian airlines, etc\.【26†L25\-L33】\)\. If we treat the RTD partnership as an “investment”, its ROI could be exceptional – e\.g\., even a NOK 1m investment yielding ~NOK 1m in profit annually once mature would be a 100% ROI\. Currently, RTD profits might still be modest as they reinvest in marketing, but as volumes grow, ROI will climb\. It’s also an **asset\-light expansion**, which is ideal given Himkok’s limited equity\.
- **ROIC by Segment:** Return on invested capital for the bar segment is high, as it’s an operating business with minimal working capital\. The distillery segment’s ROIC is harder to parse but likely moderate: the small distillery itself probably generates a few million in revenue on maybe a NOK ~3–4m net asset base \(pot still, etc\.\), giving perhaps ~15–25% ROIC\. The RTD segment’s ROIC, as noted, could become very high due to low asset base\. If we include the pending whiskey distillery, that will initially *drag* ROIC down – whiskey production ties up capital in barrels that won’t generate revenue for years\. However, if successful, the whiskey venture could eventually produce healthy returns\. For now, overall **ROIC** \(return on invested capital\) for the company can be approximated: EBIT 1\.988m plus adjust for tax gives NOPAT ~1\.54m; invested capital \(equity \+ interest\-bearing debt\) ~ \(2\.136m equity \+ ~13\.5m debt\) ≈ 15\.6m\. That yields ROIC ~9\.9%\. This is slightly above the company’s cost of capital \(estimated ~6%, see WACC below\), indicating value creation, albeit not dramatically high yet due to recent heavy investments\.

**Weighted Average Cost of Capital \(WACC\):** Himkok’s WACC is relatively low thanks to its heavy debt weighting\. With ~91% debt and 9% equity, and considering debt is cheap \(1–4%\) and equity in a small private firm might expect ~15% return, we estimate **WACC ≈5–6%**\. For example, using 5% cost of debt \(a conservative assumption for future interest rates\) and 15% cost of equity: WACC = \(0\.91*5%\)*\(1\- tax rate 22%\) \+ 0\.09\*15% ≈ 4\.55%\*0\.78 \+ 1\.35% = ~4\.8% \(after\-tax\) \+ 1\.35% = **~6\.2%**\. If much of the debt is quasi\-equity \(owner loans\), the true WACC might be higher\. Nonetheless, the current capital mix lowers WACC\. This helps justify leveraging – as long as they can earn ROIC above ~5–6%, they increase equity value\. However, high leverage also raises financial risk \(discussed in Risk Profile\)\. Management might consider rebalancing the capital structure \(e\.g\. retaining earnings to boost equity or converting some debt to equity\) to ensure long\-term stability\.

**Future Capital Needs:** The major looming investment is the **whisky distillery up north**\. This will be capital intensive – building a “state\-of\-the\-art” facility to put Norwegian single malt on the global map【37†L193\-L200】\. If this is undertaken by Himkok’s company \(or a subsidiary\), it could require tens of millions NOK over the next few years \(land, equipment, warehouses, operating expenses while whiskey ages\)\. Likely, external investors or loans will be sought to fund it, as Himkok’s balance sheet alone can’t easily absorb it\. The plan may be to secure local funding or grants \(perhaps from regional development programs\) – especially since remote distilleries like Myken and others have navigated similar paths\. Any such move will alter the capital structure significantly and must be weighed against current obligations\. **Payback period for the whisky distillery** will be long \(whisky must age ≥3 years, realistically 5–10 years for premium single malt\)\. We project the payback period could be ~8–10 years after launch, given initial negative cash flows and then potential strong sales if the product succeeds\.

In summary, **Himkok’s capital structure is aggressive but has fueled growth**\. The company smartly leveraged debt and partnerships to expand its product lines without diluting founder ownership\. Investments in the bar and micro\-distillery have already paid off in brand equity and savings; the RTD venture shows early signs of high return; the upcoming whiskey project is a bet that could yield long\-term rewards\. Prudent management of debt \(ensuring interest costs remain manageable and maturities are staggered\) will be crucial\. Currently, debt service is low\-cost, but any tightening in credit or additional borrowing for the whisky expansion will necessitate careful cash planning or an injection of new equity capital\.

## Cash Flow &amp; Liquidity Analysis

**Operating Cash Flow:** Himkok has generated positive operating cash flow for the last three years, reflecting the profitability of operations and effective working capital management\. In **2021**, despite being a partial year of operation under the new company, strong government support and a rebound in trade likely produced solid operating cash flow \(roughly estimated NOK ~3–4m\)\. In **2022**, operating cash flow was robust – net income of NOK 1\.345m plus depreciation \(1\.591m\) plus a large working capital inflow \(they increased payables and intercompany loans\) resulted in an estimated **NOK ~7\.1m** cash from operations\. This aligns with the observation that cash was used to fund big investments in 2022\. In **2023**, operating cash flow remained healthy: net profit NOK 2\.961m plus depreciation 0\.813m gave ~3\.774m, and working capital changes added roughly \+2\.0m \(e\.g\. more accruals to group and others\) – yielding **~NOK 5\.8m** operating cash flow\. This cash was used to build cash reserves \(cash increased by NOK \+2\.558m\) and repay a bit of debt\. The **quality of earnings** is good: reported profits are largely converted to cash, excluding some timing differences\. Notably, the large financial income in 2023 \(1\.502m\) was likely non\-cash \(perhaps forgiveness of a loan or revaluation\), but even without it, cash from operations covered expenses\.

**Free Cash Flow \(FCF\):** After capital expenditures, free cash flow has been mixed\. **2022** saw negative FCF, as the company plowed cash into fixed assets and likely the whiskey venture \(capex \+ financial investments &gt; NOK 12m\)\. That was funded by operating cash and increasing debt\. **2023** likely saw positive free cash flow: with ~5\.8m from ops and relatively modest capex \(~NOK 1\.3m in new assets net of disposals\), FCF was around **NOK 4\.5m**\. This allowed debt servicing and cash build\. Over a multi\-year view, cumulative FCF is still negative due to the heavy 2022 investments, but these are expected to generate returns in coming years \(so one could consider them growth capex\)\. The **allocation of FCF** has been toward expansion rather than shareholder distribution\. In fact, instead of dividends, a group contribution was given in 2022 \(1\.996m\) – effectively upstreaming some cash to the parent, maybe for tax optimization\. No dividends have been paid otherwise, meaning earnings are largely reinvested\.

**Cash Reserves vs Fixed Costs:** At end of 2023, **cash and bank** stood at NOK 6\.161m【8†L203\-L211】\. Monthly fixed outlays \(labor, rent, utilities\) are roughly estimated at ~NOK 1\.5–2\.0m\. Thus, the cash reserves cover roughly **3 months of fixed costs**, providing a decent liquidity cushion\. This is important in a seasonal business; it means they can weather a couple of slow months or an unexpected closure \(to some extent\) without immediate crisis\. Additionally, they have unutilized overdraft&#x2F;credit lines \(not explicitly stated, but most businesses maintain one\)\. The current ratio of 1\.16【5†L77\-L85】 and quick ratio ~0\.89 indicate they are just about able to meet short\-term obligations – a slight improvement from 1\.10 in liquidity in 2022【5†L79\-L87】\. The quick ratio below 1 is due to inventory on the books; however, the high proportion of cash sales means liquidity is actually stronger than the quick ratio suggests \(inventory can be turned to cash reliably via ongoing sales\)\. The **acid test** ignoring inventory still leaves ~NOK 3\.234m \(cash \+ receivables\) vs 10\.967m current liabilities – but note, current liabilities include 2\.4m of taxes \(which will be paid out of already\-collected VAT from sales\) and 3\.9m of group payables \(which are flexible\)\. Adjusting for that, they have sufficient liquidity\.

**Seasonality of Cash Flow:** Cash flow is seasonal following earnings\. Typically, cash builds up in high season \(summer, December\) and then is drawn down in winter\. For example, after the strong summer 2023, they likely had a cash buffer that helped through the slower winter\. Government authorities in Norway also often return excess VAT or grants annually which can cause cash inflows at certain times\. **2022’s year\-end cash was low \(NOK 3\.603m\)【8†L203\-L211】** because they had just made big investments; in 2023 they wisely allowed cash to replenish to 6\.161m\. One can expect Q4 and Q1 to have cash outflows \(due to tax payments and slower sales\), and Q2–Q3 to restore cash\. The company must manage the timing of big payments \(like spirit duty, VAT quarterly\) to ensure no crunch\. So far, no liquidity crunch is evident – they did not need to take on short\-term bank debt or emergency loans even during COVID \(thanks to support and internal funding\)\.

**Working Capital Management Trends:** The trend from 2021 to 2023 shows **working capital improvements**\. Receivables were kept low, inventory grew only modestly despite revenue doubling \(indicating efficiency gains in inventory management\), and payables increased \(they used more supplier credit and intercompany financing\)\. For instance, the current ratio improved slightly and the liquidity rating went from “Tilstrekkelig” to “Tilfredsst\.” \(satisfactory\)【5†L77\-L85】\. This suggests management attention on cash management\. They likely negotiate favorable credit terms – perhaps the state monopoly pays them promptly for spirit sales, and Aass might front some RTD costs\. Additionally, by year\-end 2023 they had higher accruals \(other short\-term debt up to 2\.977m\)【10†L243\-L250】, which could include deferred salary \(13th month pay due in Jan\) or accrued expenses, effectively using the balance sheet to conserve cash\. The only caution is the reliance on the parent company for short\-term funding \(3\.881m owed\) – while it’s been a helpful tool, they will want to clear or formalize that as the business stabilizes\.

**Cash Conversion Efficiency:** A useful metric, **cash flow to net income**, shows that in 2023 operating cash ~5\.8m vs net 3\.0m, so ~190% – meaning they converted earnings into even more cash \(due to working capital release\)\. In 2022 it was even higher due to big payables increases\. This indicates conservative accounting \(no aggressive revenue recognition\) and good cash discipline\. It also gives confidence that reported profits are of high quality \(i\.e\., backed by cash\)\.

**Dividend Policy:** The company has retained earnings to strengthen equity \(no dividends yet\)\. Given the still thin equity, it’s prudent to continue retaining profits\. The group contribution in 2022 was a special case \(likely for the parent to utilize losses or for tax planning\)\. Barring that, we expect no cash dividends until major growth investments are behind and leverage is reduced\.

In summary, **Himkok’s liquidity position is sound**, especially considering the challenging recent years\. They maintain enough cash to operate smoothly and have shown they can generate cash from their operations consistently\. Key is that they avoid overextending – the upcoming capital projects must be timed so as not to drain cash below safe levels\. The positive cash flows from the bar and RTD will hopefully fund the whiskey expansion partially\. They should also keep an eye on short\-term debt: eventually that NOK 3\.9m to the parent might be called or needed elsewhere, so building an equivalent buffer would be wise\. Overall, current liquidity management earns high marks, contributing to a **“satisfactory” credit rating** for the company【5†L77\-L85】\.

## Growth Metrics &amp; Ratios

**Revenue and Profit CAGR:** Since its founding in 2015, Himkok has exhibited strong growth\. Using available data, from an estimated ~NOK 10m in 2015 to NOK 48m in 2023, the **compound annual growth rate \(CAGR\) is roughly 22–25%**\. Focusing on recent years, the recovery from the pandemic fueled a sharp rebound: 2020 to 2023 CAGR is about 47% \(as 2020 revenue was very low due to lockdowns\)\. A more normalized view: 2018–2023 CAGR ~8–10%\. The **EBITDA CAGR \(2018–2023\)** is lower, reflecting margin compression, but still positive\. Net profit grew from near zero in early years to almost NOK 3m now\. The trajectory suggests that, barring external shocks, mid\-to\-high single digit growth is sustainable from the core business, with additional spurts coming from new ventures\.

**Same\-Store Sales Growth:** Comparing bar revenue to itself \(excluding new revenue streams\), **same\-store sales** in 2022 vs 2019 were likely flat to slightly up \(the boost from global recognition offset by lingering pandemic effects early 2022\)\. In 2023, on\-premise sales likely grew a bit above inflation \(~5% YoY\) as tourism fully returned and the \#11 world rank attracted new patrons\. So, we can say **YoY same\-store sales growth** was mid\-single digits in 2023\. This is solid given an already maxed\-out venue\. It indicates the bar is finding ways to increase yield \(maybe higher prices or events\) even without more seats\. Future same\-store growth will rely on optimizing hours \(opening earlier or adding brunch? Unlikely for a bar\) or pricing&#x2F;menu innovation to increase ATV\.

**RTD Sales Growth:** The **RTD segment is experiencing explosive growth**\. Launched in 2022 with two products, by 2023 added a third \(Paloma\) and expanded to ~500 retail points【37†L187\-L195】\. The RTD sales volume likely grew by &gt;100% from launch to the end of 2023\. For instance, if 2022 saw ~50k liters sold, 2023 could be &gt;100k liters \(the interview notes they produced 100,000 liters of Paloma cocktail including bar and cans【27†L342\-L350】\)\. Revenue from RTD likely grew similarly \(perhaps from ~NOK 3–4m in partial 2022 to ~NOK 7–8m in 2023\)\. This yields a **growth rate of ~80–100%**\. As distribution saturates domestically, growth will moderate, but there’s still room: new flavors, deeper market penetration \(the Spirits Business article mentions “set to expand…with potential to export”【37†L187\-L195】\)\. If they begin exporting RTDs \(e\.g\. to neighboring Nordic countries or duty\-free\), that could drive another leap\. We project RTD revenue could reach NOK 12–15m in a couple of years, implying a ~25–30% CAGR over the next 3–5 years for that line\.

**Customer Acquisition Cost \(CAC\) vs Lifetime Value \(LTV\) for RTD:** As a product line, RTDs have a different dynamic than the bar\. **CAC** for RTD can be considered in terms of marketing spend to gain a customer \(or a retail account\)\. Himkok leveraged its brand and Aass’s network, so CAC has been low\. Essentially, by being “Himkok,” stores were eager to stock the products, and initial marketing was via PR \(e\.g\. announcements in industry media\)【37†L187\-L195】\. The biggest “CAC” might be listing fees or promotions in grocery – which are limited\. Meanwhile, **LTV** of an RTD customer could be high if they develop loyalty \(e\.g\. a consumer who repeatedly buys Oslo Mule cans\)\. Given the product quality and awards, repeat purchase rate should be good\. If we quantify: suppose they spent NOK 0\.5m on launch marketing and acquired 50k customers, CAC = NOK 10 per customer\. If each customer buys an average of 10 cans over time with profit say NOK 5 each, LTV = NOK 50, an LTV&#x2F;CAC of 5x – quite favorable\. These are rough numbers, but clearly the partnership model has kept CAC low\. Maintaining brand buzz \(cocktail competitions, social media\) will keep CAC low\. LTV can increase if they expand product range \(cross\-sell to same buyers\)\. Overall, the RTD line benefits from **Himkok’s existing brand equity – a huge advantage in CAC&#x2F;LTV** compared to a startup RTD brand\.

**Projected ROI – Whiskey Distillery:** The planned whiskey distillery is a long\-term growth project\. Return on investment will come only after aged whiskey is bottled and sold, which might be 2027 onward\. If we assume they invest NOK 10m and produce a first batch that sells for NOK 15m in 5 years, that’s a raw 50% return \(not considering interim costs\) – but realistically, there will be ongoing production cycles\. The ROI will depend on scale and market reception\. Notably, interest in Scandinavian single malts is rising, so a successful “Himkok whiskey” could command premium pricing globally\. If they manage to become an iconic Norwegian whiskey, ROI could be excellent \(comparable small distilleries like Stauning in Denmark have attracted high valuations\)\. However, initial years will yield negative returns \(costs with no sales\)\. A sensible projection: IRR in the first 5 years might be negative, turning positive by year 8–10 when steady sales begin\. Over a 15\-year horizon, a well\-executed whiskey distillery could achieve an IRR of 15% or more – but that is speculative\. They appear to be banking on climate and water advantages to make a unique product【32†L137\-L145】\. We will revisit this in Sensitivity Analysis\.

**World’s 50 Best Bars Ranking vs Revenue:** There is anecdotal but strong correlation: each time Himkok climbed in ranking, global interest increased\. For example, after being named **\#17 in 2018**, 2019 was \(by reports\) a record year for Himkok’s tourist patronage\. Then in 2020–21 with the pandemic and a drop to \#43, revenues plunged\. Climbing back to **\#11 in 2024** likely contributed to a notable uptick in high\-spending visitors in late 2023 and bookings for 2024\. The ranking serves as global marketing that money can’t buy\. Many visitors will come specifically because of the list, leading to higher occupancy and even merchandise sales \(some guests buy bottled spirits as souvenirs\)\. We can estimate that being in the top 20 might add **10–15% revenue** vs if they were not on the list at all\. This could be on the order of \+NOK 5–6m annually\. Thus, the correlation is meaningful\. Himkok’s strategy of brand building and unique collaborations \(like fashion shows linked to their cocktails【35†L113\-L121】\) aims to keep them in the spotlight, which indirectly drives revenue growth\.

**Growth Rate vs Industry:** Himkok’s revenue growth outpaces typical bars \(most bars have flat or low growth unless they expand or franchise\)\. It also is growing faster than the average craft distillery in Norway \(which might grow ~5–10% annually\)\. Their multi\-channel approach is key\. If we combine all segments, a realistic near\-term growth rate is ~10% annually \(bar grows a bit, RTD high growth, whiskey adds from zero to something\)\. Longer\-term, if the whiskey and possible new venues \(maybe a second Himkok?\) come online, growth could re\-accelerate\.

To summarize, **Himkok’s growth metrics are positive**: strong historical CAGR, outstanding product line growth \(RTD\), and intangible brand factors fueling sales\. They appear to be entering a new growth phase with the distillery expansion\. The challenge will be to maintain momentum in the core bar while executing these new projects\. If successful, Himkok could transform from a single\-bar company into a small beverage group, with growth rates and multiples more akin to a startup – which is the trajectory they seem to be following\.

## Valuation Metrics

**EBITDA Multiple \(Comparables\):** Valuing a premium bar&#x2F;distillery like Himkok can draw on both hospitality and spirits industry comparables\. Pure bar businesses often sell for around **4–6× EBITDA** \(due to location dependence and limited scalability\)\. Distilleries or beverage brands can fetch higher, say **8–10× EBITDA** or more, especially if growth is high\. Himkok straddles these models\. Considering its strong brand, unique concept, and growth ventures, an investor might pay a premium multiple\. For instance, if we apply an 8× EBITDA to 2023 EBITDA \(~NOK 2\.8m\), we get ~NOK 22\.4m enterprise value\. A 6× would be ~NOK 16\.8m\. However, these figures likely undervalue the **brand intangible and growth option** \(RTD, whiskey\)\. World’s 50 Best Bars winners that have sold or raised capital \(like Singapore’s Jigger &amp; Pony group, etc\.\) have commanded higher multiples due to brand value and expansion potential – sometimes **&gt;10× EBITDA**\. If we assume 10×, that’s ~NOK 28m\. We should also consider the group’s debt: EV includes debt, so equity value would be EV minus net debt\. With net debt ~14\.5m \(20\.6m debt – 6\.1m cash\), an EV of ~22–28m would yield equity value of only ~7\.5–13\.5m\. That seems low given Himkok’s reputation; clearly, much of the value lies in future growth not captured in current EBITDA\.

**Enterprise Value from Sector Multiples:** We can approach via **revenue multiple** as well, which is common for beverage brands\. Large spirits firms trade around 4–6× revenue, but small craft brands maybe 1–2× revenue \(if mostly low\-margin bar sales\)\. Himkok’s mix complicates this: its bar revenue wouldn’t get a high multiple, but its branded products might\. If a strategic acquirer \(say a spirits company\) valued only the RTD and spirit brand part, they might pay 2–3× that segment’s revenue\. For example, RTD &amp; bottles perhaps ~NOK 10m revenue – at 2× that’s NOK 20m just for those rights, plus the bar itself valued separately\. Another angle: the **parent Something Local AS** likely views Himkok as a platform to develop brands\. The internal **Proff valuation** tool might give a hint if used \(not publicly, but the site suggests the value could be higher than book equity\)\.

Given the uncertainties, a fair **estimated enterprise value** might be in the **NOK 25–35 million** range currently\. This incorporates current profitability with a premium for brand&#x2F;growth\. If the whiskey project and RTD export succeed, that EV could increase significantly \(perhaps doubling\)\.

**Intangible Brand Value:** Himkok’s brand is a major intangible asset \(goodwill, in effect\)\. The accounts show no goodwill on books as of 2023【8†L169\-L177】, but the real **brand value** can be estimated by methods like the relief\-from\-royalty: If Himkok licensed its name to, say, a bar or product, what royalty rate could it command? Perhaps 3–5% of revenue\. On 2023 revenue 48m, that’s 1\.5–2\.4m potential royalty\. Capitalize that at a royalty multiple \(say 8×\), the brand intangible might be worth on the order of **NOK 12–20 million**\. This is admittedly speculative, but it aligns with the notion that a buyer would pay significantly for the name and recipes\. Another data point: global awards \(e\.g\. “Best International Bar” etc\.\) often translate to higher commercial value – being a perennial top 50 bar gives the brand credibility to launch products \(which they’ve done\)\. The brand enabled them to sell a **Himkok Old Tom Gin** at Vinmonopolet at a premium price \(their gin retails similar to other craft gins\)\. That reflects brand equity\. We can thus assert that **Himkok’s brand is a multi\-million NOK asset** – likely worth more than the tangible assets of the company\. It’s also key for future valuation because if they were to franchise or open a second location, the brand would drive success without having to build reputation from scratch\.

**5\-Year Projected NPV of RTD Line:** To gauge the RTD line’s value, we project cash flows over 5 years\. Assume 2023 RTD revenue ~7m, growing at 20% CAGR to ~17\.5m by 2028\. If gross margin ~45% and some marketing overhead, perhaps net contribution margin 20%\. That would yield ~NOK 1\.4m profit in 2023, rising to ~3\.5m in 2028, with cumulative cash flows maybe ~NOK 12m \(sum over 5 years discounted\)\. Discounting at ~10% \(higher risk\), the **NPV might be ~NOK 9–10m**\. If export or new products accelerate growth, it could be higher\. Conversely, competition in RTDs could dampen it\. Nonetheless, given the trajectory and partnership, an NPV in the high single\-digit millions NOK seems plausible\. A simpler market\-based valuation: RTD businesses often trade at high multiples of earnings if growing; if by 2025 it makes say 2m profit, at 10× that alone is 20m\. So clearly the RTD line holds significant optionality value\.

**Price&#x2F;Earnings \(P&#x2F;E\) Ratio vs Public Spirits Firms:** Public spirits companies \(e\.g\. Diageo, Pernod Ricard\) tend to trade around 20–25× earnings\. Smaller consumer goods firms might be 15×\. Himkok’s current **P&#x2F;E** \(based on 2023 net 2\.96m\) is not directly observable, but if we use our earlier equity value estimate ~NOK 10m, that’s a P&#x2F;E of ~3\.4 – extremely low\. This is because current earnings are suppressed by high costs and low equity base\. If one believed Himkok should trade at even a fraction of a public peer’s multiple, the implied valuation would be much higher\. For instance, at a 15× P&#x2F;E, net 3m implies equity value 45m, minus debt ~14\.5m gives EV ~59\.5m\. That might be optimistic until the new ventures bear fruit\.

In reality, a pure P&#x2F;E view is less useful here due to the growth investments\. A buyer&#x2F;investor would likely value on a **Sum\-of\-the\-Parts**: one part a stable bar business \(with say NOK 2m steady EBITDA valued at 5–6×\), plus the high\-growth RTD and future whisky \(valued on potential\)\. Such a sum might yield a higher overall multiple than current earnings alone justify\. Also, the fact that the company’s equity is only NOK 2\.136m on books【10†L249\-L257】 means a high ROE right now \(net 2\.96m on 2\.14m equity = 138% ROE\!\)\. That is not a sustainable measure, but it underscores how undervalued the book equity is relative to actual business value\.

**Benchmarking Multiples:** If we compare to other **Nordic craft distilleries** – for example Oslo Håndverksdestilleri \(OHD\) or Egge Gård if they were valued – those with strong brands have seen valuations in the tens of millions NOK, even if profits are small\. Himkok, with its bar cash flow and brand, likely would command at least as much\. Also compare to high\-end bars: very few sell equity publicly, but one analogous case is London’s **Nightjar** group which got investors to expand – their valuation hinged on brand strength, not just EBITDA\.

In conclusion, **Himkok’s current valuation \(enterprise value\)** can be roughly bracketed in the NOK 25–35m range based on conservative multiples, but the **upside potential** \(intangible value, growth options\) is significant\. If management executes on growth plans, the valuation could scale up towards a higher multiple of earnings or revenue\. Essentially, the market \(were it to sell\) would price in not just today’s earnings but the expectation that Himkok can monetize its brand globally \(through RTDs, spirits, maybe franchised venues\)\. For an investor with that vision, paying a P&#x2F;E of 20 \(or EBITDA multiple 10\+\) might be justified, which would put enterprise value closer to NOK 60m \(as a speculative high\)\. For now, any valuation must acknowledge the risky nature of expansion and the heavy debt load, which drags down valuation until more equity value is created\.

## Industry Benchmark Comparisons

To put Himkok’s figures in context, we compare against benchmarks from **top global bars, Nordic hospitality averages, and craft distilleries**:

- **Revenue per Venue:** World’s 50 Best Bars vary widely in revenue\. Many cocktail bars have annual revenue in the $1–3 million range \(≈NOK 10–30m\)\. Himkok’s NOK ~48m \(≈$4\.5m\) revenue is **among the highest for a single bar** globally\. This is partly due to its size \(multiple bars and large capacity\)\. For example, anecdotally, American Bar \(London\) or Dante \(NYC\) might do a few million USD; Himkok’s revenue likely ranks in the top tier of bar operations worldwide\. This showcases excellent utilization and suggests Himkok’s concept is commercially successful, not just critically acclaimed\.
- **Profit Margins:** High\-end bars typically operate on thin margins\. A well\-run bar might achieve 10% net margin; many run at 0–5%\. Himkok’s ~6% net is slightly above the median\. Meanwhile, **Nordic restaurant industry net margins** are around 3–4%【5†L83\-L91】 \(Norway’s high cost base\)\. So Himkok is outperforming the average Nordic hospitality outlet in profitability\. However, compared to **large distillers** \(like Arcus&#x2F;Anora in Norway, which had ~13\.5% EBITDA margin in 2019【57†L3\-L7】\), Himkok’s 5\.8% EBITDA margin is lower\. This is expected, as big distillers benefit from scale and distribution networks, whereas Himkok runs an experience\-heavy model\.
- **Cost Structure:** Labor cost ~37% at Himkok vs typically ~30% in global bar industry \(but in line with other Scandinavian operations which face high labor costs\)\. Pour cost ~28% vs global bar ideal ~20–25% – slightly higher, possibly due to including RTD\. Rent&#x2F;occupancy ~5–6% estimated, which is quite good; some bars in cities like NYC or London have rent &gt;10% of revenue, but Oslo rents, while high, are mitigated by Himkok’s high sales volume\. **Prime cost \(food\+labor\)** at ~65% is higher than US bar benchmarks \(which aim for &lt;60%\), but again in Scandinavia 65–70% is common\.
- **Employee Productivity:** Revenue per employee ~NOK 1\.26m \(≈$120k\) at Himkok\. For comparison, a typical restaurant in Norway might be ~NOK 0\.8–1\.0m per employee\. World’s best bars, due to skilled bartenders and often fewer seats, might be in a similar range ~$100k per employee, so Himkok is on the high side, indicating efficient operations albeit with a lot of staff\. Profit per employee ~NOK 78k \(≈$7k\) vs hospitality norm of only a few thousand \(some even negative\)\. So on that metric, Himkok shines, though still far from other industries \(tech etc\., which isn’t a fair comparison\)\.
- **Inventory Turnover:** A craft distillery often has slow inventory turns because of aging \(e\.g\. whiskey distilleries might turn inventory &lt;1x a year due to years of aging\)\. Himkok’s 4\.6x overall is much faster\. Versus a pure bar, which might turn liquor inventory perhaps 8–12x a year \(monthly or faster for popular items\), Himkok’s is slower – attributable to their dual nature \(bar \+ production\)\. Given they hold inventory for production and future sales, a slightly slower turn is expected\. It’s a balanced figure when splitting the difference between bar and distillery norms\.
- **Cash Conversion Cycle:** Many bars have negative CCC \(they get cash from customers before paying suppliers\)\. Himkok’s roughly \+40 days CCC is because of inventory and some receivables\. Compared to manufacturing \(which often has \+60 days\), it’s better\. It’s a bit higher than a pure bar’s likely negative CCC\. But compared to a distillery \(which might have cash tied up in barrels for 3 years – effectively CCC in hundreds of days\), Himkok’s is low\. So in between benchmarks – reflecting its hybrid model\.
- **Debt Levels:** Most independent bars carry little debt \(they are often equity\-funded by owners, or have small loans for build\-out\)\. Himkok’s ~NOK 20\.6m debt is **unusually high for a single bar**\. However, as part of a broader corporate strategy, it resembles more a startup&#x2F;growth company leverage\. Craft distilleries often take on debt or investor capital; e\.g\., Myken Distillery in Norway raised capital to expand\. A debt\-to\-asset ratio of ~91% is high by any standard – typical Norwegian SMEs might aim for 50–70%\. The trade\-off is supported by low interest costs currently\. Industry peers might caution that this is risky \(and indeed a low solidity of 9\.4% is flagged as “weak”【5†L89\-L97】\)\. But given the parent backing and internal loans, it’s a deliberate strategy\.
- **Growth &amp; Expansion:** Many top bars use their brand to expand \(e\.g\., Singapore’s Manhattan bar launched a bottled cocktail line, Employees Only opened branches in other cities\)\. Himkok’s approach with RTDs and a new distillery is comparable innovative expansion\. The success of such expansions in industry has been mixed – some bars struggle to replicate themselves, but products allow scaling\. On a **benchmark of diversification**, Himkok is ahead of most bars \(few have an on\-site distillery and a packaged product line\)\. In the spirits industry, big companies constantly extend brands; Himkok is effectively doing this on a boutique scale, which is relatively unique\.
- **Valuation Benchmarks:** If we consider any known transactions: A famous bar brand in London might sell for a few million GBP \(just for the venue goodwill\)\. Distilleries have sold at higher multiples; e\.g\., Denmark’s Stauning Whisky attracted large investment valuing it at hundreds of millions DKK – but that’s a bigger operation\. Himkok’s size and brand could arguably fetch a valuation similar to a small spirit brand\. Notably, a premium brand like **Bareksten Gin** \(from Norway\) gained a valuation of around NOK 100m in recent years; Himkok’s brand, while different, is also very strong – albeit not yet international retail scale\. So between bar and spirit brand benchmarks, Himkok sits somewhere in the middle in terms of valuation\.

In summary, **Himkok compares favorably to industry benchmarks in many areas \(revenue, brand strength, innovation\)**, while in others like leverage it’s taking on more risk than a typical bar\. Its margins are modest compared to global corporations but quite solid for its industry niche\. The strategic moves they’re making are somewhat trailblazing – very few bars in the “World’s 50 Best” have successfully created a retail product that is sold in hundreds of stores\. This positions Himkok potentially as a model for the “bar of the future” blending hospitality and product branding\. The benchmarks highlight that Himkok is punching above its weight in revenue and influence, though it must carefully manage financial fundamentals to ensure longevity\.

## Financial Risk Profile

Himkok’s financial risk profile is a mix of operational, financial, and market risks:

- **High Leverage &amp; Solvency Risk:** With a debt ratio over 90%, solvency is a concern\. **Equity is very thin \(NOK 2\.136m\)【10†L249\-L257】**\. This means the company has little buffer against losses – a couple of bad years could wipe out equity\. The **soliditet** \(equity&#x2F;assets\) of 9\.4% is labeled “weak”【5†L89\-L97】\. High leverage increases risk of breaching loan covenants or inability to refinance\. That said, much of the debt is internal or supportive \(not bank loans with hard covenants\), which mitigates immediate default risk\. Still, as interest rates rise, interest costs could uptick \(though presently low\)\. The company’s strategy to retain earnings will be crucial to shore up equity\.
- **Liquidity Risk:** While day\-to\-day liquidity is presently manageable \(current ratio &gt;1\), the low quick ratio and reliance on parent short\-term loans pose some liquidity risk\. If the parent company \(Something Local AS\) were unable or unwilling to extend further support, Himkok might need external working capital financing\. Seasonal swings also test liquidity – a poor summer season or unexpected event \(e\.g\. another pandemic wave or forced closure\) could stress cash reserves\. The current cash covers a few months of expenses, so any shock lasting longer could cause trouble\. Their relatively small cash buffer relative to debt obligations means they must carefully plan for loan repayments\.
- **Interest Rate Risk:** Up to now interest expense is minimal, but if the NOK 9\.65m long\-term debt is on a variable rate, interest rate hikes in Norway \(which have occurred through 2023–2024\) could raise interest costs significantly in 2024 and beyond\. For instance, 5% interest on, say, NOK 6m bank debt = NOK 300k&#x2F;year, which would erode profit\. They might mitigate this if it’s fixed\-rate or if the debt is owner loans \(which might be 0% or low interest\)\. Clarifying debt terms is important\. Currently, the risk seems low but could grow\.
- **Operational Risk – Single Location:** Himkok’s bar revenue depends on one physical location\. This concentration risk means events like a fire, license issue, or local downturn could severely impact the company\. They do have insurance, presumably, but operationally if the bar had to close for any reason, the main revenue engine stops\. During COVID closures in 2020–21, they survived thanks to government aid and pivoting \(selling bottles, etc\.\)\. A similar event without aid could be disastrous given fixed costs\. Diversification into RTD helps somewhat \(as that revenue can continue even if the bar is shut\), but RTD alone isn’t enough to cover all costs yet\.
- **Market Risk – Changing Trends:** The cocktail bar industry is subject to trend risk\. Tastes can shift, new competitors arise\. If Himkok fell out of favor \(e\.g\. drops off the top bars lists or customers flock to a new hotspot\), bar revenue could decline\. So far, their continuous innovation \(new menus, etc\.\) keeps them relevant\. But the bar scene is fickle\. They also face **regulatory risk**: Norway’s alcohol regulations are strict\. Any change like increased alcohol taxes, new limits on operating hours, or marketing restrictions could hurt sales\. For example, if taxes rise, margins on spirits&#x2F;RTD shrink or prices must increase \(possibly reducing demand\)\. As is, alcohol duty in Norway is high, but stable\.
- **Execution Risk – Expansion Projects:** The planned whisky distillery is a big undertaking with notable risk\. There’s construction&#x2F;completion risk \(delays or cost overruns\), production risk \(quality issues in first batches\), and market risk \(will consumers buy Norwegian whiskey in a crowded global market?\)\. This project will consume cash and management attention for years\. If it fails or underperforms, the investment may not be recouped, straining finances\. Similarly, the RTD line, while doing well domestically, faces competition \(big beverage firms also releasing canned cocktails\)\. If sales don’t grow as expected or if quality issues arise \(e\.g\. shelf stability problems\), that could stall momentum\. Thus far, risk is moderated by the Aass partnership – but if that partnership were to end or Aass had issues, Himkok would need a new production solution quickly\.
- **Currency Risk:** Minor but worth noting: If they start exporting RTDs or spirits, currency fluctuations \(NOK vs USD&#x2F;EUR\) could affect profitability\. Also, any equipment for the distillery may be bought in EUR&#x2F;USD, exposing them to FX risk\. Currently, operations are mostly NOK\-based, so not a significant factor yet\.
- **Personnel Risk:** A lot of Himkok’s success owes to its talented team \(founder Erk Potur, bar manager, head distiller, etc\.\)\. Loss of key personnel could impact quality and innovation\. Training new staff is costly\. There’s also general industry risk of labor shortages \(many hospitality workers left during COVID\)\. They must continue to attract top talent – their brand helps, but if they struggled to staff properly, service or output could suffer, hitting financial results\.
- **Competitive Benchmark Risk:** On the distillery side, there are numerous small distillers in Norway \(e\.g\., OHD, Egge, Myken, etc\.\)\. If one of them or a new entrant captures the imagination \(say a competitor’s aquavit becomes the next big thing\), Himkok’s spirit sales could be affected\. Similarly in RTD, global brands or local breweries could launch rival products that eat into shelf space\. The uniqueness of Himkok’s offerings \(Scandi twists, use of aquavit\) is a moat, but not an unassailable one\.
- **Risk of Overextension:** The company is doing many things – running a bar, a micro\-distillery, producing RTDs, building a whisky distillery, cultural collaborations\. There’s risk of stretching resources too thin\. Financially, this can lead to cost overruns or insufficient focus on core profitability\. Management needs to ensure core bar operations don’t suffer as they chase new projects, because the bar is still the main cash generator\.
- **Mitigating Factors:** Despite these risks, Himkok has strengths that mitigate them: a strong brand \(making equity or investor fundraising easier if needed\), a supportive parent company \(which has provided financing and can inject capital if required\), and a diversified model \(bar \+ retail products\) that provides multiple income streams\. The bar’s global reputation also means, in a pinch, they could potentially attract outside capital or even sell the brand to a major hospitality group if needed\.

In conclusion, **Himkok’s financial risk is moderate\-to\-high due to leverage and expansion, but it is being managed**\. The largest financial red flag is the high debt relative to equity, but this is somewhat offset by the nature of the creditors \(likely friendly\) and the improving profits\. The management appears conscious of risk – evidenced by maintaining a cash buffer and not over\-borrowing from banks\. A key recommendation will be to gradually de\-leverage or increase equity to reduce solvency risk, especially before big capital outlays\. If they navigate the next few years’ projects successfully, risk will diminish as new revenue flows in\. Until then, a cautious approach to cash and debt is warranted to ensure resilience against any bumps in the road\.
