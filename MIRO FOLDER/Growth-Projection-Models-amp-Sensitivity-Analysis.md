# Growth Projection Models &amp; Sensitivity Analysis

To evaluate Himkok’s future, we model growth scenarios for the next 5 years, factoring in key drivers \(bar performance, RTD expansion, and the whisky distillery launch\)\. We also perform sensitivity analysis on critical variables \(like cost of goods and debt costs\):

**Base Case Projection \(2024–2028\):** In our base scenario, we assume the on\-site bar business grows modestly \(~3% annual revenue growth, roughly inflationary increases and slight volume upticks\), the RTD line continues strong domestic growth and begins limited exports, and the whisky distillery comes online by 2026 with minimal sales at first \(whisky aging until ~2028 for first release\)\. Key assumptions and outcomes:

- **Revenue:** Grows from NOK 48m in 2023 to ~NOK 75m in 2028\. This implies a CAGR of ~9%\. Breakdown in 2028 might be: Bar ~45m, RTD ~25m, Spirits \(bottles&#x2F;whisky\) ~5m\. The bar growth is slow \(reaching ~NOK 40–45m by 2028\), RTD drives most incremental revenue \(assuming it can tap into export markets like Sweden or duty\-free, adding a few million each year\), and first whisky sales \(maybe a limited release in 2027–28 of a few thousand bottles at high price, e\.g\. NOK 1m revenue\)\.
- **Margins:** We assume stable or slightly improved margins\. Gross margin might tick up to ~75% if RTD margins improve with scale and if bar pricing increases\. EBITDA margin could rise to ~10% by 2028 as RTD achieves economies and whisky \(though small initially\) has high margin per bottle\. In NOK, EBITDA might grow from ~2\.8m to ~7–8m by 2028\.
- **Cash flow:** Operating cash flow would rise with profits; however, 2024–2026 will see heavy capex for whisky\. We project capex: perhaps NOK 5m in 2024, 5m in 2025, 2m in 2026 for distillery build and barrels\. This could consume much of the internal cash generation\. Thus FCF might be near zero or slightly negative in those build years, then strongly positive from 2027 onward when large capex ends and sales begin\.
- **Balance Sheet:** Debt may increase short\-term to fund the distillery \(maybe an additional loan of NOK ~5m in 2024\)\. Equity will grow via retained earnings; by 2028 retained earnings could add ~NOK 15m, boosting equity to ~17m\. This would drastically improve solvency \(equity ratio perhaps ~40% by 2028 if debt isn’t increased further\)\.
- **ROI:** The RTD line in base case becomes a steady contributor \(profit maybe NOK 3m by 2028\), and whiskey is still ramping \(small profit or breakeven by 2028\)\. Overall ROIC improves as legacy debt is paid down and new investments start paying off – maybe ROIC ~15% by 2028\.

**Optimistic Upside Scenario:** In a bullish scenario, assume the bar remains at full throttle \(perhaps tourism boom or adding new revenue streams like a daytime concept adds \+5% growth\), **RTD goes international** \(they find distributors in Europe&#x2F;Asia, doubling RTD sales by 2028 to ~NOK 40m\), and the whisky distillery not only produces but also draws tourist revenue \(visitors center, pre\-orders\) and possibly they release a young whiskey or gin from that distillery earlier\. In this scenario:

- Revenue could grow to &gt;NOK 100m by 2028 \(RTD being the biggest piece\)\. For example, by 2028: Bar 50m, RTD 45m, Whisky&#x2F;spirits 5m\+\. CAGR ~16%\.
- EBITDA margin might be higher due to scale \(RTD large scale production through Aass yields better margins, say gross margin 50%\+ for RTD\)\. We could see EBITDA margin ~12–15%\. EBITDA in 2028 might be on the order of 12–15m\.
- This scenario likely requires more working capital \(bigger receivables&#x2F;inventory\) but also provides cash that could fully pay down debt and fund the distillery without new borrowing\.
- Enterprise value in this case \(if achieved\) could be substantial: a company with 100m revenue, double\-digit millions EBITDA, and strong brands might be worth well over NOK 100m, yielding a multi\-bagger increase in equity value\.
- Key to this scenario is successful execution: for instance, winning global distribution deals for RTD \(perhaps riding on Scandinavian trends and sustainable cocktail themes\) and possibly global awards for their bottled spirits\.

**Downside Scenario:** In a pessimistic case, consider that competition or market changes impact them\. Perhaps the RTD fad cools off or big companies crowd them out of retail shelf space, limiting growth to maybe 5% a year or even declines\. Or the whisky project faces setbacks \(delays or a failed first batch\)\. Meanwhile, suppose 2025 brings an economic downturn reducing local spending, causing bar revenue to stagnate or fall slightly \(people go out less\)\. In this scenario:

- Revenue might only reach ~NOK 55–60m by 2028 \(a ~5% CAGR or lower\)\. Bar stays ~40m, RTD inches to 15m, whiskey negligible\.
- Margins could actually worsen if costs rise \(inflation in wages and ingredients\) faster than revenue, and if utilization drops\. EBITDA margin might stick around 5–6%, or even dip if they carry overhead for new projects without payoff\.
- If whisky investment still goes on, it becomes a cash drain with little return by 2028\. They might need to write off some of it if it doesn’t pan out\.
- Debt could increase or at least not fall, as low profits mean less cash to pay loans\. In worst case, they might violate debt covenants or need restructuring\. But given parent support, more likely they’d scale back investment to avoid insolvency\.
- The result is a much smaller increase in equity – possibly equity only grows to ~5m, or even stagnates if profits are low and distributed to service debt\.

**Sensitivity Analysis:**

- **Cost of Goods Sensitivity:** If COGS% deviates by e\.g\. ±5 points \(due to ingredient price swings or changes in product mix\), annual EBIT impact is significant\. At 2023 sales ~48m, 5% = 2\.4m\. So if inflation drives liquor and raw material costs up 5% of sales \(without price increases\), EBIT could nearly vanish \(given only ~2m EBIT now\)\. Alternatively, if they find efficiencies to cut COGS by 5%, EBIT could double\. Thus, controlling pour costs and production costs is critical\. We assume they will raise drink prices as needed to counter supplier price increases, but there is a ceiling before demand suffers\.
- **Labor Cost Sensitivity:** A 5% swing in labor % \(e\.g\., from 37% to 42% of revenue\) would reduce EBIT by ~2\.4m \(again nearly wiping out profit\)\. Norway is seeing wage inflation; plus, extended opening hours or needing more staff for new ventures could push labor up\. Conversely, improved efficiency or more RTD revenue \(which has low direct labor\) could reduce overall labor%\. Given likely wage rises, we conservatively model labor% holding steady by offsetting with higher revenue\.
- **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** If interest on debt rises by, say, 3 percentage points \(e\.g\., from ~1% to 4% average\), interest expense on ~13\.5m interest\-bearing debt becomes ~0\.54m \(up from ~0\.14m\)\. That ~0\.4m extra reduces net profit by ~13%\. Manageable, but not trivial\. If rates spiked to, say, 7%, interest ~0\.95m, eating ~32% of 2023 net profit\. So interest hikes can chip away at profitability, emphasizing the need to pay down or refinance expensive debt\.
- **RTD Growth Sensitivity:** If RTD fails to grow \(flat at 2023 level ~7m&#x2F;year\), our revenue projections would be lower by ~8m in base case by 2028, and EBITDA perhaps 1–2m lower\. It wouldn’t sink the company, but it leaves less cushion to support new projects\. On the flip side, if RTD grows faster \(e\.g\. hits 30m by 2028 instead of 25m\), that adds maybe 5m revenue and ~2m EBITDA extra by 2028, improving debt paydown and funding for whisky\.
- **Whisky Launch Timing:** If whisky release is delayed from 2027 to 2029 \(very plausible if they aim for a quality aged product\), then the model’s bump in 2028 revenue wouldn’t occur and they’d have two more years of carrying cost\. We tested a scenario where whisky contributes nothing through 2028 – the overall growth rate drops a couple percentage points, but not catastrophic\. However, the invested capital would not yield returns in that timeframe, dragging ROIC and potentially frustrating investors\. If they needed to raise cash again in 2027 to keep funding barrels until 2030, that could dilute current owners or increase debt\.
- **Exit&#x2F;M&amp;A Sensitivity:** While not exactly a financial metric, one scenario to consider: if an acquirer offered to buy Himkok, at what assumptions would owners consider it? If growth is on track \(base or upside case\), they might hold out because the long\-term value could be much higher\. But if things stagnate or risk mounts, an offer in the tens of millions could be appealing\. Since the founder is deeply involved, likely not seeking exit soon, but it’s a backdrop consideration\.

Charting these scenarios: in base case, net income might gradually rise to ~NOK 5m by 2028\. In upside, could be &gt;NOK 10m\. In downside, might stick ~NOK 3m or less\. The **debt\-to\-equity ratio** in base case improves from ~9\.6x now to ~1\.5x by 2028; in downside, it might stay ~5x; in upside, they could become net debt free by 2026\. These differences have huge implications for flexibility and risk\.

Overall, the projections show a generally positive outlook with significant upside potential, but also highlight that **Himkok’s financial future is sensitive to execution on its growth plans and external factors like cost inflation**\. The prudent approach is to plan for the base case, guard against the downside \(e\.g\., by securing financing buffers\), and actively chase the upside opportunities\.

## Key Financial Recommendations

1. **Strengthen Equity &amp; Deleverage:** It is advisable for Himkok to improve its capital structure by increasing equity\. This could be achieved by retaining earnings \(no dividends for the foreseeable future\) and potentially converting some shareholder loans to equity\. Raising external equity capital is also an option – for example, bringing in a strategic investor for the whisky project or RTD expansion\. Reducing the debt\-to\-equity ratio will lower financial risk
2. **Strengthen Equity &amp; Reduce Leverage:** Bolster the company’s equity base to improve solvency and resilience\. This can be achieved by retaining earnings \(no dividends while expanding\) and converting any shareholder loans into equity\. Consider bringing in a strategic equity investor, especially to co\-fund the whiskey distillery, to inject fresh capital\. Reducing the debt\-to\-equity ratio will lower interest burden and risk\. The current 9\.4% equity ratio【5†L89\-L97】 should be gradually raised towards industry norms \(30%\+\)\. Paying down interest\-bearing debt with surplus cash \(or using new equity funds\) is recommended to reach a more sustainable capital mix\. This will improve the company’s **creditworthiness** and ability to secure financing on better terms in future\.
3. **Tighten Cost Control and Margin Improvement:** Given that small cost swings have large impact on profit, management should continue to rigorously control COGS and labor expenses\. Aim to shave a few percentage points off COGS by optimizing supply chains – e\.g\. buy in bulk with Aass or negotiate better prices for ingredients\. Maintain pour cost discipline: track liquor yield, minimize waste, and adjust recipes&#x2F;pricing if certain cocktails fall below target margin \(18–24% pour cost range【60†L9\-L17】\)\. On labor, optimize staffing schedules to match demand – use data from POS to align staff count to hourly footfall, avoiding overstaffing on slow nights\. Cross\-train employees to handle multiple roles \(bartending, floor service, distillery tours\) to get more productivity per wage krone\. These measures can boost EBITDA margin from ~6% toward 10%\+\. Also, review **other operating costs** for savings: for instance, renegotiate rent or service contracts if possible, and leverage any available energy efficiency grants \(since distilling and refrigeration are energy\-intensive, cutting utility costs will aid margins\)\.
4. **Maintain Strong Liquidity Buffers:** Ensure that cash reserves and available credit lines are sufficient to weather unforeseen shocks or seasonal troughs\. Management should target having at least **3–6 months of operating costs** in accessible liquidity\. The current ~NOK 6\.16m cash【8†L203\-L211】 \(≈3 months coverage\) is the minimum – consider building this higher as cash flow allows \(especially before major outlays on the new distillery\)\. It would be prudent to secure a **committed credit line** \(overdraft facility\) from a bank for additional safety – even if not used, it provides backup liquidity\. Continue the good working capital practices: prompt invoicing and collection for RTD sales, keeping inventory lean without risking stockouts, and taking full advantage of supplier payment terms\. By staying cash\-positive, Himkok can self\-fund more of its expansion and avoid liquidity crunches\. In addition, set aside reserves for large periodic payments \(taxes, duties\) to avoid any short\-term squeeze when those come due\.
5. **Phase Investments Prudently &amp; Seek External Funding for Capex:** Approach the whiskey distillery project and other expansions with a phased investment plan tied to milestones, rather than committing all capital upfront\. For example, invest in stages \(site purchase, then construction, then equipment\), and evaluate the project viability at each stage\. This will contain risk and allow adjustment if budgets or market conditions change\. Aggressively pursue external financing options for the distillery: apply for **grants or soft loans** \(e\.g\. from Innovation Norway or regional development funds\) which can reduce the financing cost\. Also consider forming a separate entity for the distillery and raising capital specifically for it – this would ring\-fence the main bar business from the heavy capex burden\. Possibly invite high\-net\-worth individuals or a beverage company to take a minority stake in the distillery venture; their funds and expertise can alleviate pressure on Himkok’s balance sheet\. Essentially, **don’t overburden the core business with the full cost of new ventures**\. By sharing investment and risk on big projects, Himkok can protect its liquidity and debt levels\. Moreover, continuously forecast and reforecast cash flows for these projects – if cost overruns occur, identify them early and secure additional funding *before* cash gets tight\.
6. **Maximize High\-Margin Opportunities &amp; Diversify Income:** Leverage Himkok’s strong brand to generate more revenue from high\-margin channels\. For instance, expand the consulting and events business – the expertise of Himkok’s team is sought\-after, and consulting gigs or guest shift events have minimal costs and can command premium fees\. This not only brings extra profit but also strengthens the brand globally\. Similarly, consider launching **exclusive experiences** \(such as paid distillery tours, tasting classes, or a whiskey subscription&#x2F;pre\-order program\) – these can create upfront cash flow \(e\.g\. enthusiasts paying now for a future whiskey allocation\) and build hype, effectively funding production\. In the RTD segment, capitalize on the current momentum: invest in marketing to cement Himkok RTDs as category leaders in Norway \(so that if competitors enter, Himkok retains shelf space\)\. Also, explore select export markets for RTDs to drive volume – but do so asset\-light \(via distributors\) to maintain margins\. Another avenue is **merchandise** \(branded glassware, bar tools, apparel\); while small, it has high margins and enhances brand loyalty\. If bar capacity is a limiting factor, evaluate if reservation fees or minimum spends on peak times could modestly increase revenue per seat \(some top venues successfully implement this\)\. Finally, down the line, if the brand remains strong, **licensing or franchising** could be an option \(e\.g\. a Himkok pop\-up in another city operated by a partner, generating royalty income\)\. By diversifying income streams, Himkok reduces reliance on any single segment and can capture more value from its brand\.
7. **Monitor Performance &amp; Adjust Strategy Proactively:** As the business grows more complex \(bar \+ distillery \+ RTD\), it’s crucial to strengthen financial monitoring and adaptability\. Implement KPI dashboards for each segment – e\.g\. bar RevPASH, RTD sales by region, distillery output vs targets – and review them monthly\. If RTD sales growth shows signs of plateauing, be ready to ramp up marketing or introduce new flavors to re\-ignite growth\. If certain cost lines overshoot \(say, labor creeping up\), take corrective action immediately \(hiring freeze, efficiency improvements\) rather than letting it erode annual results\. Scenario planning should be a continuous exercise: for example, plan what steps to take if revenue drops 10% \(which costs to cut first\), or conversely how to deploy a 10% revenue upside \(where to invest or accelerate projects\)\. Given the dependence on global rankings and reputation, also have a PR&#x2F;marketing budget ready to maintain brand profile – the **return on maintaining top\-tier status is high** in revenue terms, so consider it an investment\. Essentially, stay agile: the management should be prepared to pivot strategies for the RTD line if consumer preferences shift, or to delay&#x2F;accelerate the whiskey rollout based on initial feedback and financial position\. By staying on top of financial and market data, Himkok can navigate toward the most profitable outcome and avoid pitfalls\.
8. **Protect the Core Business:** Amid expansion, ensure the core bar operation continues to thrive financially\. The bar is the beating heart of Himkok – it generates the brand cachet and a large share of cash flow\. Thus, maintain the high service and quality standards that draw customers and rankings\. Invest in staff training and retention \(happy staff lead to better customer experiences and stable labor costs\)\. Also, guard the bar’s profitability by not letting the distillery side cannibalize it – for example, don’t redirect too much production to external sales if it means the bar has to buy outside spirits at higher cost\. The bar should always have first call on the distillery’s output at production cost\. Furthermore, regularly analyze the bar’s menu profitability: spotlight and upsell the most profitable signature drinks and consider dropping items that are labor\-intensive but not price\-justified\. A well\-oiled, profitable bar will generate cash to fuel other ventures and can justify premium pricing due to its world\-class status, so keep its financial health front and center\.

By implementing these recommendations, **Himkok can solidify its financial foundation while pursuing ambitious growth**\. In practice, this means balancing innovation with sound financial management: continue to push boundaries as a bar and brand, but underpinned by disciplined cost control, prudent financing, and strategic use of its sterling reputation\. This approach will mitigate risks and position Himkok to not only remain one of the world’s top bars, but also evolve into a highly successful multi\-faceted drinks business in the coming years\.
